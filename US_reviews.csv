0,amanda,"Good for small hands, but brittle",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have pretty small hands, even for a lady.  I like the Nalgene bottles but the circumference is usually too large for me to feel comfortable carrying it other than by the strap.  I sometimes get sloshed in the face when drinking from the wide mouth bottles.  In my search for a water bottle I could take to client meetings and not feel embarrassed about, I looked at many options, even the glass bottles.  However, none of them compared with the KOR ONE bottle.  This thing is elegantly designed and narrow enough for me to grab without having to use two hands.  This is a well designed bottle!  When you flip the top back, it clicks in place and won't flop forward onto your face when you're drinking.  When closed, the cap is secure and doesn't leak.  It opens again easily by the push of a button.  There's also a little band of rubber at the bottom for a non-slip grip.  The product description tells of all the features and they are all accurate.  The grips are non-slippery, the top stays back when you're drinking, the water doesn't taste plastic-y by the end of the day and it stays classy looking because there's no paint or design to start peeling off the side.  There's a small logo like a water drop at the bottom and the top of the cap says KOR ONE but I appreciate that I'm not advertising every time I take a drink.Update: I LOVED this bottle! But, it fell out of my trunk onto the garage floor and the hinge cracked, making it useless. I have to update my review because this bottle is too expensive to break so easily. I just can't feel good about replacing after a month...and it can't survive a short drop."
1,P Guerra,"MOTIVATIONAL bottle!!! Great quality, I love it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my bottle for days when I'm hiking or I need bigger quantity of water on the go!!! It also works perfectly for cold green tea!!! I love the quality of KOR products, I just bought a bunch of their bottles and water filter system for my home. They are BPA free and also very convenient to use. My favorite thing about this specific model is that it comes with motivational messages when you open the cap, so you can always keep motivated while being hydrated!!!!"
2,Kimani Griffin,A must have in Florida,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had been eye balling this Water Bottle since Early January. Of course my only concern at the time was the price. But after finally buying one, I wish I would've bought one months ago!I love this thing! Not only is it ergonomic But it's really stylish and functional. The top clicks into place and has a silicon seal for the lip of the bottle. So there's no leaks. And best of all, the base has a silicon bottom so it's less likely to tip over.However my favorite part is its iconic design. Something about just makes you want to consume MORE water. Since I've bought one. I'll fill mine atleast 4 times a day. Really great way to stay hydrated.All in all, if you're in Florida you NEED this. This is an extremely iconic, durable, and superior water vessel that's unlike anything in its category.I'll definitely recommend this."
3,Jonathan Miller,Quality has declined; prone to lid locking failures,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The quality of this water bottle has declined. I used the same model/brand in the past. Perhaps there are some production problems? The lid does not properly close. Having used this bottle for the past few weeks, I have had problems insuring that the lid locks into place. It is also quite easy to accidentally open the lid. As a result, I sometimes spill water on myself or my gym bag. Because it is a small gap in the fitting, it is not readily noticeable until you realize it is leaking. I purchased this water bottle as a replacement for the exact same model/brand that I had used for years, but it is not nearly as well made. As a result, I need to give this bottle a two star rating. It is usable but not reliable, and I will be looking for a replacement."
4,X-Sparker,"Solidly made bottle, bigger than expected",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This bottle is bigger than I anticipated. But it is very nice and seems to be well made, although the hinge part feels a little flimsy like it could break easily. It is not easy to open this bottle single-handed and the mouth where you drink from is quite big so you could splash water around if you are actively moving while trying to drink from it. Overall I'd say this is a good buy, but not the best considering the high price point."
5,Christin Lilly,easy to use and I love the spout for drinking,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a fairly heavy water bottle.  It is well built, easy to use and I love the spout for drinking.  I wouldn't recommend this for hiking, since it is on the heavier side, but this is a great take and use bottle for daily errands, office work, etc...  The color is soothing and the bottle is easy to hold. Love how the lid stays securely in place and the drinking spout stays covered and keeps germs away!"
6,Richard Scott,It's just a water bottle.. ..right?,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I recently picked up the (r)Egrets bottle (green one with the pictures embossed), and I've been really pleased with it.First, I should mention that this thing is a lot bigger than I thought it would be. I was expecting, well, a normal-sized water bottle. Something I didn't notice/realize/appreciate was that it's just under a foot tall. If you have a limited height area, you'll just have to lay it on its side.I've traveled with this thing, packing it in my carry-on. I've done a fair bit of walking and done some accidental dropping. It's not even been phased, this sucker is well-built and feels bulletproof. The top is very secure, and the seal didn't even have anything spilling into the top portion of it. The weight of the top is more than enough to keep it from flipping closed; I've gotten into the habit of flicking my wrist to close the top. My girlfriend was prompted to ask me if this was my 'new zippo', since I have a knack of figuring out clever hand tricks for opening/closing objects in this style.The mouth opening is smooth, and wide. It's got a very comfortable taper, and I just recently started feeding it ice. There's no cramming or mess, as the mouth is wide enough to take a standard ice machine cube without issue. No word on ice-tray cubes.The only detraction that I'd have is that you do have to get used to how the button for opening it works. You often have to ensure you hit it dead-center, or one of the two side releases won't disengage fully. But, I mean, if the worst thing you can come up with for a water bottle is that it's slightly harder to break the seal on it, well..."
7,Lucy,Unique and wonderful to drink from,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I have had this water bottle for at least 6 months now maybe longer.  My husband received it for free at a plastics trade show.  Lucky me!  I love the mouth on it.  Its smooth and easy to drink from.  It takes ice cubes from my ice maker and it fits in the drink holder in my car.  I have a collapsible part inside the drink holder of my car that makes room for a larger cup and it fits just fine.  I play tennis at least 3 times a week and always get compliments on it and have people asking me where they can get one.  I have dropped it on pavement twice and not had any cracking or leaks but sadly this week in a rush to fill it I knocked it off the counter with the lid open and the lid broke right off.  That's the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars. I thought maybe I would get something different since I didn't even know the name of this one.  I just did a general water bottle search and after looking at the Sigg and couple of other metal ones I realized I kept looking for one that had a mouth like the one I threw in the trash on Monday.  The next site that said it had water bottles was Amazon and there it was my water bottle. I know mine broke but I'm going to get another one right now.  I hate the one Ive been using.  I don't like having to unscrew the top and Ive had the one with the straw in it and it was really hard to clean.  This bottle is easy to clean and I can see if its dirty on not.  Anyway its not unbreakable but it was pretty durable and I love drinking from it.  Now I can tell all the people who have asked me about it where to get one.
8,Suhail S,Very interesting bottle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The bottle is of very good quality. I got the onyx color, and I really like the color of the trim and the main plastic portion of the bottle. The only thing that I dislike is that the hinge feels like it is a little bit flimsy, and I could do with out the ""kor stone"" thing. Also the bottle in the onyx black color will show a lot of scratches, the bottle got many little micro scratches on the first day, jut being in my bag. But overall, it is a great bottle thats just a little different from the rest."
9,Buyer,Poor Build Quality - Engineered to Last 8 months or Less,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  **UPDATE**10/03/2012Changed from 3 to 1 stars.Changed the title from ""It's ok"" to what it is now.After dropping and breaking my first KOR bottle I bought another.  Through normal wear and tear one of the latches that keeps the top closed broke and it no longer stays closed, so it's in my recycle bin.  No drops, no abuse, in fact, I was hyper-careful with it since I broke my first one.  Clearly these guys make a poorly designed product.  I would not recommend anyone buy this water bottle.  Maybe they've fixed these design flaws in updated designs but this one is dud.**END UPDATE**I bought this water bottle mainly because I wanted a BPA-free alternative to the small 12oz water bottles I kept drinking out of (and recycling, and by the way they tasted like plastic and that was gross).  Here are my pros and cons:Pros - Stylish (get lots of complements, I jokingly call it my iWaterBottle) - BPA-freeCons - DOES NOT FIT IN NORMAL ROUND CAR CUP HOLDERS (someone said it fit in car cup holders and I was very disappointed that it didn't) - FragileI'm giving it 3 stars because the oval base does NOT fit in my car cup holder (or any other that I have tried) and because it didn't survive a fall very well.  Yes, I know, it's MY bad that I dropped it but one fall from less than 4 feet and it broke the lid and bent the hinge.  I was able to make it work for a couple more months but then one of the plastic hooks in the lid (that make the seal tight) broke and it leaked water all over the place.  My nalgene bottle, on the other hand, has taken several 4+ foot falls, has been on numerous camping trips, and is still doing great -- but it's not BPA-free.If you want a stylish water bottle that people will comment on, and you can protect this thing, then by all means buy it.  If you are hard on your gear I say skip it and get a BPA bicycle water bottle or something like that which can take a licking and keep on ticking.Cheers."
10,Andrew G,"So much potential, but my experience hasn't been worth the price..",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Let me first say, I love this bottle. It's fantastic, I love almost everything about it. However.... When I received it, it was scratched on the back and it doesn't look super pretty with a nasty scratch down the back, and for twenty-five dollars, I was really surprised they'd let something like this get out, however, there is also a problem with the rubber lid. Not the one that seals the bottle but the extra lid that contains the paper slips, it continually falls out. Overall, fairly disappointed in this bottle. If I hadn't gotten a scratched one and the rubber thing stayed in, I would be much much much more in love with it.Update: It just broke. I didn't even have it a ear and the hinge just snapped off... very unhappy."
11,Lisame,"Awesome waterbottle, AWFUL Quality",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this water bottle last week because it looked awesome and looked easy to drink out of (I am a passionate weightlifter who needs a lot of water throughout the day).  My first impressions of this water bottle were great.  The packaging was nice, the water bottle looked nice, and it was easy to fill up and drink out of.  However, as soon as I brought it outside my house it fell out of my water bottle holder in my backpack and hit the ground.  Mind you this is only about a 3 foot fall, and the water bottle was only about 1/5 full.  It cracked in not one, not two, but THREE different places. It leaks everywhere when trying to drink out of it now, and it's useless.I have had many cheap water bottles before, and they all suffered the same fall that this one did.  They are all in completely perfect condition from over 2 years of use, and this one couldn't even last a day.Awesome concept for a water bottle, but absolutely horrible construction."
12,Marco,Very cool design - Not easy to clean,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  When I received the bottle I just loved it. It is incredibly big and very good looking, with a few issues.Pros:-Water tight seal-The bottom rubber ring is great to hold it in place on any surface-The phrases are a nice touch-The bottle as a whole is very well made with no apparent defects whatsoever-Holds a good amount of waterCons:-Been tranparent it will attract scratches, but all clear plastics are like that-When you close it you get the feeling it just isn't tight enough. It is more of a psychological thing.-It is difficult to clean if you fill it with natural juices like homemade OJ. It would stick to the walls, making it difficult to clean, specially with a spoonge to avoid scratches and the size doesn't help either.-Don't leave it with any liquid for too long, been made out of plastic, it will retain flavors and odors.All in all, it is a design statement and a nice bottle. It is too big to carry around, unless you have a backpack of sorts or plan to keep in your car, gym or whatever, just don't drop it as this crystal clear plastics scratch or brake if they hit concrete like on a sidewalk.I like it and will order the set that includes all the colors."
13,Tony,Average to Below Average,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I enjoyed this bottle for a short time. It looked very trendy. Made me feel as though I was helping clean the world. Idk. It isn’t very durable. If dropped, the lid is very fragile and did not survive most times. Once the lid is cracked or damaged a certain way, you can’t close the lid anymore. I did like the large opening. I opted to purchase many S’well bottles since."
14,Amazon Customer,Just okay,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like the mouth opening. It's an ideal size and doesn't get water all over the place when you're walking or doing some kind of activity.  It doesn't leak.  It's easy to keep clean.  The downside of this product is its shape: it's elliptical and doesn't fit it most conventional cup holders.  It's a no-go for the gym and I have to put it in the map pocket in my car door because it doesn't fit into the cup holders in my car.  Also, unless you have big hands, drinking from this bottle is a two-handed operation.  Overall I like this water bottle, but the shape and size are drawbacks.  I would like to see a similar product with the same mouthpiece but in a standard shape/size."
15,Caroline,Love the color & the motivational quotes!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I really love this water bottle. The color is so intense and pretty. I am really pleased with the quality of the product and that it is 750 MlThe bottle is BPA free and also very convenient to use. I had never seen a water bottle with a motivational cap so I thought that was a plus! Its definitely a unique product.
16,Julian,Beautiful form but terribly weak design. Recommend not to get.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  No doubt this bottle looks good and feels good to use. Unfortunately the bottle has a fatal flaw; a weak hinge design. My first one broke completely at the hinge from a one-time fall of around 40-50cm in height. Ok fine....user fault. So I went to purchase the same bottle. However, a crack developed at the hinge area barely after 6 months of normal use. The bottle was never dropped at all. Seems like this is a common complaint for this bottle.  Expensive product and totally not worth it!ProsBeautiful formBPA free""Perfect spout"" feels goodConsPricey productWater gets into the grooves and joint during washing, which might mislead you to think its leaking if not dried for some while.Weak hinge which will crack easily even with normal useDoes not fit into cup holder"
17,Laura Henri,Futuristic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Edit. almost one year later, and this bottle has failed to stand up to the test of time. It leaks, the seal is for naught, the top is wobbly and doesnt click closed correctly.I purchased this water bottle for my Fiance, because the one he had was bulky and it leaked. Plus this one just looked super cool, and because he is super cool, it fit.It really does look like no other water bottle out there, and the design isn't just all fluff and edges, it actually functions quite well.I love that you can choose the colors, that it has a nice handle. It has a good weight to it even when filled. The wide opening is convenient for when you might want to drop some ice cubes in there, and also its easier to get some big gulps when you are very thirsty. I like the way it opens and closes with one click, and there is no leakage at all.It says you can put it in the dishwasher but we are choosing to hand wash it to make the seals last longer.Now I want one for myself!"
18,Andrew Savage,The Latch Failed in my Backpack After 4 Months and Ruined My Laptop,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought a KOR ONE about 4 months ago for my girlfriend. My goal was to get her an ""over-engineered"" water bottle because I love it when people over-engineer simple things, like water bottles. She absolutely loved it and all her friends at college were constantly asking her where she bought it/ what brand of water bottle it was.This is where the good ends and the bad begins.After 3 months the latch to close the bottle began failing randomly when carrying the bottle from the handle. Eventually, while the bottle was in her backpack the latch failed completely, the bottle opened and all of her notebooks and laptop was completely ruined.Yes the design is cool, yes it's unique and has some desirable features HOWEVER the latch doesn't work! Allow me to repeat: the most important part of any water bottle - the part that prevents the water in your bottle from destroying everything around it - isn't engineered well and WILL FAIL OVER TIME. It only took 4 months...."
19,Mark,"Overpriced, overmarketed, but still using it.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've waited almost two years to write this review. I bought this item in July, 2010.I'm one of those guys who gets suckered into the newest, hippest, coolest thing going. And Kor One's marketing scheme got me too.This is an overstylized, overpriced water bottle, plain and simple.Pros1. Holds a lot of water2. People ask about itCons1. Costs a lot for what you get2. The rubber ring seal tends to become black rather quickly (very hard to clean, even with alcohol wipes/chemicals). You have to order replacements from the website ($1), it took approximately 4 weeks to receive one after ordering online. (simple envelope with a stamp).3. Clumsy, easy to tip over4. Awkward size, It's pretty tall, it can fall out sometimes of bags with not enough nylon elastic.5. The clear blue plastic easily gets scratched and doesn't look very nice.6. Difficult to clean7.Verdict - Would NOT buy again. But will still use it until it breaks down."
20,Darla,Beautiful design makes this,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I was under the impression this was glass but it is plastic. That was my mistake not reading the description but in actuality in glass this would have been too heavy. Beautiful  in design but it was a little challenging to get the Open. Actually it was quite frustrating. I had to go online to their website and see how to open this. Now  that I am aware of how to use this I do like it and I do like the feel on your lips. The rounded edges do you feel better then rigged ones that were used to. A little pricey  but I do like overall.
21,kat,looks as great as it leaks,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was really excited about this water bottle because the color is so pretty and it's a great shape, but it leaked from the top the first time I used it. After using it just three times, the top became loose from the latch, and the base of the bottle (I hand-washed it each time and never dropped it). It was super leaky which was disappointing.. function over fashion for me, peeps."
22,CK,"Looks awesome, but is NOT practical",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have had 3 of the these water bottles. I really liked them in the beginning, because they look so nice. However, the bottle isn't practical for everyday use. The rubber ring around the top of one of my bottles got distorted, and stopped sealing the water. This caused my water to leak all over the place (I know the Kor website does sell replacement rings for a dollar or so). Also, one of mine broke, since it slipped out of my bag and fell to the ground. Let me just tell you that once your bottle hits the ground or falls, it will be broken or ruined from then on. I know we shouldn't be dropping our water bottles, but accidents happen. I didn't like having to worry about making sure my water bottle was safe. I ended up getting a Nalgene bottle, which is super sturdy and leak proof. PLUS, it is more than 1/2 the price of this water bottle. If you are looking for a bottle for everyday, this one might not be that great. However, if you just want a bottle to drink around the house, this could work. It IS pretty.."
23,Karrie,Leaked,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I really wanted to like this water bottle.  It is quite large, with the ""handle"" on the top.  I could live with that.  However it seemed to be difficult to open and close.  I thought I could live with that.  Then it leaked all over my bag, cannot live with that. It was definitely closed properly when it leaked.  I expected more from a $25 water bottle."
24,V,HOLDS A TON - WELL DESIGNED!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  very nice product. i love that they hold tons of water - i ordered other water bottles that were also nicely designed, but i do an hour-long spin class and the others didn't hold as much water as these do. my spin bike at this new gym is designed for laying bottles into the holders so it doesn't matter what size. but these are a weird not-round shape and might not fit into all bike and car bottle holders, so ask the company about that. I could do without the little inspirational saying on the lid, it looks cheap. Otherwise, a nice wide mouth to sip out of, doesn't taste plasticy."
25,networkguru,"Great if you're only using water.... If not, not so great...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Unfortunately one of these was used for fruit juice...You know where I'm going.In the back of a car, left for a day, it grew a colony.Since there is no way to disassemble the flask, it is almost impossible to completely clean. After three cycles through the dishwasher, and then a good day soak in a mild bleach solution, there was still a hint of black mold in what appears to be some kind of tiny gap or seam at the top of the bottle where it narrows down for the neck.No amount of brushing, pipe cleaning or anything else could shift it.Sadly it is on the way to a better place. I think a glass equivalent might be a better option. I'm eyeing up something like this 

Takeya Modern Glass Water Bottle with Silicone Sleeve, Ice Blue, 18-Ounce

  .Stay hydrated this summer !"
26,Therabbitssing,Beautiful but pricey,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a beautiful water bottle.  There is nothing that looks like it.  Yes, it's the water bottle Tony Stark had in 'Iron Man 2'.  For looks, it's a solid 5.  But it's quite expensive for a bpa free plastic bottle.  There is a wide mouth that almost accommodates a normal size ice cube but does not.  You will still need to use fridge made ones or ice sticks and not ice cube trays.  The ""core stones"" are an insult.  While I thought they might be cool, they are nothing but very thin prices of paper! The idea was great, but could they be at least be plastic chips or something? Ignore the stones or make your own out of paper.  Same deal.  The bottle itself is very nice though."
27,D. R. Brown,Best Water-bottle I've Used To Date,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Mid January, I got back into going to the gym & got into the afternoon aerobics classes at the Y. I quickly learned that my tiny little water-bottle wasn't going to cut it for a 45 minute Zumba class. I purchased a larger bottle that had decent reviews, but the lip of the thing was weird & I ended up with more water on my shirt, than my in my mouth. When I finally found this water-bottle, I'd found perfection! This thing doesn't leak (so I'm not worried about it rolling around in my car & in my bag on the way to the gym), the mouth of the bottle is comfortable, the handle makes it comfortable to carry, & the rubber bottom keeps the bottle sitting upright & from slipping when I place it on my yoga mat. I'm glad I purchased this item!"
28,Jodi Goodsell,Good for room temp water drinkers...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Beautiful for sure and arrived very quickly but I gave this away and opted for the Thermos Tritan instead.  The spout on the KOR ONE is larger than the Intak or Tritan spout but is a catch 22.  There is only the drinking spout, you can't open the vessel for cleaning or for adding large cubes of ice and the spout is only big enough to get small cubes from bagged ice or the ice maker in to the bottle.  This makes them melt so quickly that I found it uncomfortable to sift them out with my teeth.  May be a great fit for some but not for me."
29,N. P.,"Pretty, yet not very practical",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have to start by saying that my water bottle gets more compliments than I have in a lifetime! Everyone who sees me with it LOVES it.It does not fit in a cup holder, so when I took it to the cubs game, I couldn't put it in the holder, or in a car, or anywhere else where you can find a cup holder.It's difficult to drink out of it when you're in a moving bus/train, and since this is my daily commute, it sucks having to always wait until we're at a full stop to drink.I usually put fridge water in it, but I don't mind water that's room temperature, so I continue to drink it throughout the day, and you get that ""plastic smell"" when the water is no longer cold.I can easily drink from it with one hand. I can use my thumb to press the button to flip the top open and drink, and that's nice when I have stuff in my other hand. It's a bit large and requires me to carry a decent sized purse ...but I ALWAYS need water, so I guess this is a good thing.Update: I recently dropped it as I was coming out of my sister's car ...about a 2 foot drop. It's fine, except that it now leaks water when it sits on it's side. I would expect a little more durability from a $35 water bottle!!!"
30,Gianna,I like it because - it is BPA free - it ...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this bottle (ice blue color) to drink water in my office.I researched a lot and i bought this bottle. I have been using it for a month and my conclusions are:I like it because- it is BPA free- it has the most stylish design- it has a big opening and i enjoy drinking from it (not like other bottles with small opening)- it has a handle, when i was researching about what to buy i thought that was superfluous, but i actually use it and it is usefulI didn't care about the stickers, i threw them awaythe only thing i don't like is that i wish it was 1000 ml because i drink a lot of water. but i decided to buy soon another one in cobalt blue.Happy with my choice, will buy again"
31,Steven,"Product Placement, & just good water.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ok, so it's a bottle and it holds water, simple thing that you can get anywhere. Well, maybe not anywhere, I looked this bottle up because I saw it in a movie and wanted to see how much it was. The movie was Iron Man 2 and it was Robert Downey Jr.'s bottle in that movie, (shameless product placement, but it actually worked on me.)As for the bottle itself it does what was designed to, hold water. The lid/cap that folds all the way back flush with the bottle's side is great. The shape of the bottle is nice to hold and the rubber ring on the bottom is helpful in keeping the bottle from slipping all over.I like the bottle but I don't like the price $20 plus for a bottle, is kinda ridiculous. Not to mention that the bottle does come with little round message stones that reveal a message when you look under the cap/lid. In reality they are just pieces of card-stock paper(or FiberStone® paper, according to the website) with a design on them. The fact that I got 3 of them for free with my bottle was good, but these ""stones"" are about $2 for a set of 4 and then you get to pay shipping too. My suggestion is outline the stones that come with the bottle & make your own.The bottle does sweat when brought out from cold fridge to room temp or hot day, but I don't know many bottles that don't sweat, so no big deal there. To me water is water unless you are trying to drink hot water, The bottle is great for taking to school and use during classes. Fits in my shoulder bag just fine.I only gave 4 stars because I think paying $20 plus for a water bottle is ridiculous, I know, I paid that much but I had a gift card that was going to expire so I grabbed the first thing that I wanted. Overall I'm happy with the buy, & speed of delivery, was very fast. This is a good product, if only too expensive. Do check to see what size you are buying because there are different sizes and they vary in price."
32,Jenascia,Beautiful water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Got 3 compliments on it the first day I brought it to work. Makes me want to drink more water. Was able to put a cute quote in the lid also. Handle is... wait for it... HANDY! There is a very hard plastic feel to the components so I am nervous about it breaking easily but I'll keep my fingers crossed. Will update review if it breaks.
33,sjw,I Am So Cool with This Bottle . . .,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It really is stylish and eye-catching.  I use it at work and people are always asking where they can buy one.  I like it because when I go to a meeting, I can lay it down on its side instead of have it sticking up tallways and blocking people's view.  It does not leak when laying down, upside down or anything.  Very easy to carry around.  Also like the drinking opening and the cover does not crash into your mouth -- it stays open while you are drinking, then closes very securely shut.  I have the blue one; I have seen also pink and orange -- all super cool.  As with all my stylish accessories, I don't toss them around, so I don't expect mine to break.  Be a little careful -- it isn't a basketball, but it isn't a baby either.  Normal use and I expect it to last forever."
34,Jenny Hornes,I made the KOR-ect choice (:,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  By the photo and description, I thought that the bottle would be small so I was a little hesitant but it was the cheapest bottle that looked durable and it had so many great reviews, so I figured that I would give it a shot. Boy, am I ever glad I did. the bottle is PERFECT. it doesn't leak, it holds a lot of water (which is important to water drinkers like myself!) and it's really a very attractive bottle! I love that it has a little handle on the top and an inspiration ""stone"" on the lid when you open it. On the more functional side, it has a sturdy button release on the top, and it seal by the little rubber around the stone which makes it completely leak-proof (which, until now I thought I would NEVER find) and the opening is literally JUST the right size to fit in ice cubes. I would say my only complaint is that the oval shape doesn't allow it to fit into my center counsel in my car, but that's really nit-picking."
35,leinani45,"Love, Love, Love!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  After having MULTIPLE issues with other kinds of water bottles cracking, losing their seal, etc. I decided to try the KOR One. It is AWESOME! I am pretty hard on my water bottles and it has stood up to extreme heat, dropping (multiple times) and just general wear and tear. It is a little big for most cup holders, but most of the time I just set it next to me in my seat and it is fine. I love the rubber seal inside and feel comfortable with leaving it in my bag all day without getting it wet. I also really like the rubber stopper on the bottom. Over all, I am very happy with this water bottle, and would happily purchase another if needed."
36,BWI,Everyone wants one!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Got this for one of the consultants who is pregnant to encourage her to drink more water. She loves it. And now everyone wants one. We ended up purchasing several more and so far everyone who has received one totally loves it.*************After a month of us, the hinge on the cap has broken so the bottle doesn't keep suction anymore. We didn't expect a thirty dollar water bottle to break EVER, let alone after a month.We'll order a replacement and see what happens..."
37,lyz,Good but tall and narrow,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I really like the bottle, but the cap is high and makes the bottle unnecessarily tall in my opinion, taller than most water bottles. This wouldn't bother me if I didn't carry it in the water bottle pouch on the side of my backpack. Since the bottle is so tall and narrow, it falls out of the pouch very easily if I bend over, if I'm running, when I set my backpack down on the floor, or when I'm one-shouldering my backpack... Which for a college student are pretty common activities.If you have a deeper pouch in your backpack then I don't think this should be a problem. The bottle was just taller than I expected and I didn't have this problem with other bottles. I wouldn't have minded if the bottle was a little wider and shorter."
38,Christopher Dowell,Great bottle to replace the disposable water bottle!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought 2 of these, 1 for me & 1 for my Brother.  We love them!  They are easily hand carried & the video reviews helped alot & were dead on accurate. Every time we go walking or to & from work, these Kor One Vessels go w/ us.  What a great money saver too.  We never have to buy bottled water anymore since we have a filter & this. This is definately the bottle that replaces the disposable water bottle & it's PET free to boot.  It's what I call neo-tech contemporary & also quickly has become a conversational piece w/ the rest of the Family & friends & co-workers. I highly recommend this product to anyone who's into hiking, traveling, college, school, work, yoga, gym, etc.  You'll be happy you bought one."
39,Kazuco Ura,Wide mouth + Full size Ice Cubes = A cool refreshing drink.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Love it. Own three for my whole family. The mouth opening is better than most water bottles I've seen, and i can drop in ice cubes, without having to crush them. as for looks... I always get stopped and asked asked what i have in my hand, and when I tell them its a water bottle, where they can get one. the only issue is that the power stone lid on these sometimes is a little lose. I lost it on one of my bottles that way. All in all, a great product."
40,Juan L,Looks great and holds a good amount of water!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  What can I say? it's a water bottle. Nice design and carries a good amount of water. There are some parts of the bottle that are a little hard to clean well. Mold could potentially develop over time in such areas. Not a deal breaker though. Other than this, it works well!"
41,Luis Fernando,A waste of $30! Breaks so easily!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Okay, so I bought this bottle literally about a week ago. I really loved the design and concept of the bottle and just fell in love with it. The first week I had, it was great. Its a big, easy to clean bottle that gets the job done. I always get compliments on it too. But about a week after I got it, I was in the library studying and I accidentally dropped the bottle of the desk and the bottle latch cracked! Now the desk wasn't that high off the table and the floor was carpeted, so tell me how this bottle still cracked! This is ridiculous, I would see how if I dropped the bottle onto concrete, or from somewhere really high, but this was just your standard desk in a library! How can they charge such a high price for a material so cheap. They say its made from such high quality and that the design was really thought out, but obviously not! This is a MAJOR design flaw! And the worst part is that the limited lifetime warranty will take weeks to get a new one, and I have to pay for the shipping, and they might not even give me a new bottle! That mean's I'll have to pay just to get my broken bottle back if they decide to not cover my bottle! This is absolutely ridiculous. I'm better off just buying a new water bottle and save my money shipping it off hoping that my bottle will be covered. This was such a waste of my money. I HIGHLY recommend that you not buy this water bottle. I am beyond dumfounded by this huge design flaw. A water bottle should be able to withstand a few falls and bumps. I'm am done with this. Done!"
42,JPL,beautifully designed product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The Kor One ""Hydration Vessel"" has a pretentious name, but it's a beautifully designed product. Easy to carry. Easy to open. Easy to fill. Big enough for ice cubes. Surprisingly heavy duty so it will last.I love it and has been using it.To clean your bottle in a more effective way, I bought the following product:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004OCLJ?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B00004OCLJ&linkCode=shr&tag=swiclu-20&linkId=DM2ZMZSNWQEZ5XUZCheers!"
43,Pamela schmoock,"Very nice, well made.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Carry handle, nice spout that locks down easily. Just like drinking from a water bottle. Love it. Dishwasher safe top rack but I’ve been hand washing it for now."
44,S. Mcgurk,I love the bottle itself,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love the bottle itself, it's very cool and it gets a lot of compliments. I had a little issue the ring on the top getting a little bit green but I think if I had just washed it more frequently I could have avoided that issue. I got a new one and I will be washing the seal more often and hopefully that solves the problem. Just make sure you keep it clean and wash it by hand. I saw other reviewers who tried putting it in a dishwasher, it very specifically says not to do that, so that has nothing to do with the product."
45,Travis C,"I really wanted to like this, it looked so cool in the Ironman ...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I really wanted to like this, it looked so cool in the Ironman movie, but it is really more trouble than it is worth.  The top does not seal well enough to keep water in if it is inverted and it will drip on you.  Works good uprights, but it it falls over you run a good risk of leakage.  This can be problematic as it is just a bit too big for cup holders in vehicles.  Plus, the latch on the top is not as strong as it should be and only locks down on the first try 50% of the time, and even then allows water to leak.  DO NOT TRY SHAKING THIS, YOU WILL GET WATER/LIQUID EVERYWHERE.  Finally, the bottle has no double wall so anything cold gets condensation on the outside quickly.  I was hoping to carry this as my water bottle in my plane, but it is only functional as something that looks good and not as an actual water bottle.  Not worth the $25."
46,Charleston 2CV6,Looks? YES Functionality? YES,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  UPDATE: Okay, so teh bottle has now been in use for months and is still in great shapes, no damage from a few drops and knock-overs!  So I am pleased and feel like it was worth the money I spent!I bought this a gift for my husband ... he loves the look if it and the fact that Tony Stark had one made it all the more appealing!  The bottle feels very heavy and is very tall with a small footprint for it's height, so I am only waiting for it to get knocked over, and after reading all the other reviews, I am quite certain it will break!  To be clear, it looks truly amazing!  But at $30, a water bottle (by sheer intend of use) should be able to handle a few small bumps and falls!  I am loving the design so far, I will re-post in a few to give an update!"
47,smiley,great water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  it has some really cheesy ""stones"" (pieces of paper below the cap) to inspire you. comes with :imagine"" and ""be the change"" (at least mine came with those) I get that it is supposed to inspire you, but if this is where you are getting inspiration... glad it works for you, but not my thing. that said I put a joke homemade stone saying give up written in crayon as an inside joke only em and my wife know about. That said as a water bottle this is very nice, stylish and top notch quality. I have been using it for 3 months now, put a climbing clip on the top so I can clip it to my bag and could not be happier this bottle."
48,Bobbi Adwell,This is the best water bottle I have ever owned!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is the best water bottle I have ever owned!  I have owned several KOR water bottles but KOR ONE s my favorite.  The chrome color is very stylish and I always get comments from people on how cool my water bottle is.  In addition to it being pretty, it is very pleasing to drink out of as well.  I also notice that I drink more water when using my KOR ONE...this is a purchase you won't regret."
49,Brigitte,Leaks and tastes like plastic,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had bought the smaller Kor water bottles and was happy with the nice handle, attractive look, and sturdiness.This larger version with cute imagery just isn't up to par, unfortunately. When I lay it on it's side, it slowly leaks. After using it for a couple months straight it has that plastic taste you associate with refilling a disposable water bottle one too many times, which is the reason you'd get a permanent one to begin with.And yes, I wash it properly.I'm a sucker for anything cute, so I'm giving it 2 stars only because while it works it's adorable."
50,Adam,Manufacturing quality went downhill.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my second purchase of this water bottle (first one broke when it was dropped). I was happy with the first one to order a second. But to be honest, the top doesn't close like my first one. So I end up leaking a little bit. I have to be mindful of the lid when closing. This was not an issue with my first purchase of this water bottle years ago. So it seems as if they've changed something about the manufacturing process. Or perhaps I just have a dud."
51,Hobbes,"Sorry, Iron Man fans: latch mechanism too fragile for real-world use",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just missed the return window by one day :(This is my second Kor One: the first *arrived* with one of the two small plastic latches broken (they hold the lid on). The replacement worked fine, but within about 2 wks, the lid didn't quite latch as solidly as when new...an examination revealed that the spring in one of the 2 latch mechanisms had slipped sideways about 2 mm, so that side no longer locked in place. The spring is inside a sealed inaccessible chamber in the lid, and now the lid won't latch at all."
52,RF,Bottle Leaks,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  After a few months my bottle started to leak. I thought maybe the O-ring was warped or something, but it turned out one of the hooks the secures the lid had broken off. Not sure how or why that happened, but since the lid is somewhat of a carrying handle I think that played a roll. Why KOR would make those hooks out of plastic then have a handle on the top of the bottle makes no sense. I was willing to repair the bottle at my cost and emailed KOR for assistance. After 3 weeks, no response -based on price, quality and lack of customer service I'm giving this product 1 star - less if I could."
53,Chris Olson,It's a very nice water bottle. But it's still a water bottle.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just got it. It is a very nice water bottle. It's way bigger than I expected, and will not fit in my car cupholders. The button latch mechanism isn't as smooth as I would have expected, but it works. And the ""perfect spout"" is indeed nice to drink from, but it's not nearly as life altering as they make it sound. lol  And the stones with inspirational messages? Talk about a gimmick! Overall, it's a water bottle. It's a very pretty one. But it's still a water bottle."
54,pen name,"Dirt, Dust, and Scratches. Buy form KOR.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The actual product is great and I love it and is 5 stars. But I gave it 4 because of the packaging. It did not come in any packaging whatsoever. It was loose in the box. This means the water bottle came with dirt and dust, something sticky all over the sides on the chrome, and scratches which is the worst part because those can't be washed off like the dirt, dust, and sticky stuff did. This was a major disappointment seeing as I dropped $25 on a water bottle should have bought it from KOR's own website. It is several dollars cheaper and it would have come in perfect condition since KOR values being at the high end of hydration."
55,Caroline S,It gets the job done and it looks basically like it does in photos but feels cheap up close,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  For the price, I expected something that was of higher quality. It gets the job done and it looks basically like it does in photos but feels cheap up close. Also does not ""swivel"" when you press the button to open, though the locking feature is nice so that the cap doesn't hit you as you're drinking. Also note that the ""stones"" are just peaces of paper."
56,Jackie H.,Emits strong chemical smell after a few uses,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been using the bottle for a month. Had been looking for some time for a BPA free bottle; I found the design and the many positive reviews very appealing. Bottle does look attractive but after only 2 weeks of use my water started stinking like a bad chemical brew! I sure don't feel safe drinking from it. That defeats the purpose of paying $36 to have a chemical free bottle. I had been washing the bottle with warm water as instructed & let it completely dry (to avoid mold / bacteria build up), stored it only open when empty to keep air flowing; so I don't think that I did anything to cause this. Another observation: The bottle fits due to its unique oval design in no car cup holder; and due to its very tall height and rounded, oval base - it is a bit unstable, empty or full, and tips easily over ... which is a problem given that many reviewers have said that it breaks easily once it drops. A real disappointment!"
57,S.O.,"Great bottle, but pricey",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like the gadgets, and this is the gadget of water bottles. When my kids have their sporting events (soccer, softball, baseball, basketball), I like to bring along a cold drink - especially on those hot summer days. What I do is mix some Gatorade with water and fill it about a 1/3 full. Then, I put it in the freezer at an angle overnight, and before the sporting event, I'll fill it to the top with some more Gatorade/H20. The ice keeps the drink cold and refreshing.So far, the quality is excellent. My kids have dropped it more than a couple times and it's held up quite well. The handle is perfect for carrying, and the spout is just right (feels good to drink out of). You'll also get some nice comments like ""ooohh, nice water bottle"" but then you'll get some looks after you tell them how much it costs  :-)I bought two, one for each kid, and I'll probably buy another for myself. great product, well designed, but a little pricey."
58,Jc Denton,Kor One Vessel,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Was not happy about the packaging, basically came in a piece of cardboard, not even a cardboard box.  The bottle was scratched, almost like it had been used.  I ordered one from another store, and it was scratched as well, so I don't think it was the packaging, it must have come out of the factory like that or before it was shipped to another location for distribution.  The overall aesthetics are nice(except the scratches..), but the overall it isn't worth $35, more like $20, add in the scratches and I wouldn't pay over $10.  I can imagine if I dropped this with the full weight of the water inside, it would probably shatter into a hundred pieces, so don't count on using this in rugged environments.  Bottom line, the only reason to buy this bottle is for the looks."
59,mike mckeever,Great water bottle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Everything everyone else talks about being great about this bottle is true. The failures I read about were that it would not seal after washing in the dishwasher, which you are supposed to hand wash only and the hinge. Just using the bottle you can tell the hinge is a weak point, and if you tweak the top the wrong way or drop it, it becomes an open container, forever.Other than my belief that the hinge will fail I really like this bottle and will buy another."
60,Wendy S.,I wanted to really like this sleek water bottle but the lid closure is ...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I wanted to really like this sleek water bottle but the lid closure is not my favorite. You have to really push it down hard (both ends have to click for it to be fully secure) and it is often deceiving to know if it is full closed. Because of this reason, I have spilt water many times and will be purchasing a different water bottle."
61,Hsin Pai,"Hooked on the look, but...",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The aesthetics of this product--along with the many compliments I've received from friends and strangers alike--have roped me into buying a second bottle, even as I curse the broken hinge on my current ""hydration vessel."" Being familiar with the common complaints about the durability of this bottle, I was not surprised when a 1-foot tumble from my hand to the carpeted floor wrecked the flip top. All the same, it is disappointing that the same care and consideration put into the visual appeal of the KOR ONE didn't continue to its engineering. (Note: the latch continues to hold down the top, but this actually made it worse for me, because the lid appeared to stay on while allowing the contents to leak into my bag.)"
62,Chris S.,Great water bottle!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  For some reason, I've always enjoyed getting high-end water bottles. I prefer using things that last a long time over once-offs like water bottles.This one fit my needs perfectly. One of my backpacks has a water bottle pocket, but it's shape restricts me from carrying something akin to a Nalgene because of its slimmer capacity. The Kor One bottle both allows for a large amount of water and is slim and tall, fitting into my backpack pocket with ease. The ergonomic shape is quite comfortable to hold and the spout makes drinking incredibly smooth. Highly recommend, and I'll probably be getting more from this company."
63,Brian Skory,Very nice water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a very nice water bottle. The design is really eye-catching! I had been looking for a really ""cool"" looking bottle for a while and during one of the scenes in Iron Man 2 saw this and immediately did a bit of research to find it. I was surprised at how large it was when it arrived, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Obviously this wouldn't be ideal for cycling or hiking -- I think of it more as a city water bottle and take it to class or in the car with me. People love it and I've even had people ask for the name and purchase one for themselves after seeing it. BPA free is a huge bonus, helping the environment is great, and staying healthy by drinking more is important. All around a good purchase!"
64,Anonymous,Leaky and fragile.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Total piece of crap. I bought one several months ago, and after a month or two the lid would no longer stay shut (it would pop open even after just tipping the bottle over). It seemed like a great both otherwise, so I figured that perhaps I'd gotten a defective one. So I ordered a new one, and I've been using it less than a month, and this one is broken, too! Waste of money. I had such high hopes."
65,KragithZedrok,Iron Man that is all,5.0 out of 5 stars,  My favorite water bottle ever. It is super durable but the top cap for the stones likes to pop off randomly. Be sure not to wash with stones inside as they will stink.
66,Lucy,Well designed and very convenient,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The first thing I noticed is that the actual bottle appears very different in real life. Not as beautiful as the pictures because the pictures are shot against a white background which makes the white plastic on the sides blend in and the color of the bottle stand out.That being said, the bottle's extremely well designed. I love that the cap is attached but doesn't fall on my face when I'm drinking out of the bottle. I don't find it particularly heavy (esp compared to the sigg bottle I used before this). The elliptical shape also helps me grip the bottle securely when I'm drinking. I have small hands so I've always had problems with Nalgene and Sigg bottles, but this is extremely comfortable. The gel silicone plastic on the bottom of the bottle makes it very secure once it's set on the table.I think 750mL is the perfect volume, as it doesn't make a full bottle too heavy to carry in my bag, but also means I don't have to constantly refill it. The handle on top is comfortable to use as well, and means I don't have to throw it in my bag if it's already too heavy. No issues with the top accidentally opening/leaking.I'm not an outdoorsy person so the fact that the bottle's not too ""rugged"" is not a problem for me. For carrying back and fourth from home/office/school, this is just perfect."
67,Soggyinseattle,Great concept.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a great concept, and overall I'm pleased with it, despite the fact that it's huge (stands almost 10 inches tall); due to it's oval width it won't fit in my any of my 2010-model car cup holders (not even the door side-pockets); when filled, it's heavy.  My suggestion to KOR is to make a more practical version that is shorter (maybe 6-8 inches tall), and a bit narrower to fit in cup holders.  It's a great looking bottle and I like the added feature of putting either sayings (that come with the bottle) or creating your own, so that when you open the cap, there's a friendly reminder sealed in the cap for yourself (mine is ""Laugh Often"")."
68,TMB,Large and handy,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This bottle holds enough water in it to get me through the work day and the opening is large enough to put ice cubes into it and the lid stays put without falling into my face when I take a drink from it. The handle makes it easy to carry when hands are full with other items and the rubber bottom keeps it from knocking over. The only downside is that it doesn’t fit in my cars cupholder.
69,Peter Steers,Beautiful but poor/fragile hinge design.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros: Beautiful bottle, good handle design.Cons: Not machine washable.  The ""Stones"" are dumb and pointless, and their inclusion means an extra piece of rubber on the top is needed to keep the ""stones"" in.  Worst of all, the hinge is extremely weak and broke after accidentally dropping the bottle once;  the plastic doesn't lend itself to repair.  Also pricey for a plastic bottle. I'd recommend a normal Nalgene or similar for convenience and durability."
70,Charles Haze,Cool but not a long term bottle,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have bought 2 of these becuse i like to stay hydrated and i saw it in an ironman movie and couldnt resist. They have a flaw in the closing mechanism and hinge where it is very weak and prone to cracking.(broke 2 bottles this way just opening it normally, didn't drop them or anything) Another possibility might be that the plastic is more brittle or mine just happened to be smacked around in shipping and just gave out after a few uses. If you buy one love it, use it, clean it, and only drink clean drinking water out of it.(High calcium water will fog up the plastic and be difficult to clean."
71,v12tommy,I love my water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love my water bottle. All of my co-workers comment on how good my ""Iron Man"" water bottle looks when they walk by. My only complaint is the motivation disk on top, or whatever they call it. Every now and then the rubber piece holding it in will fall off, and then the little paper disk goes floating to the ground. It seems like a gimmick, and I never pay attention to it when I'm drinking anyway. Other than that, the water bottle is solid. I'd definitely buy again if I need a second water bottle."
72,Erica Vincent ,People will steal when they realize the awesomeness!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Keep the black on black in stock please! I love these soo much! I have a cupboard full of them. The kids and family members all keep stealing or using them.
73,BRUCE-KAT,Quality!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I’m all about quality n this bottle is according to  my standards!!It’s beautiful with a unique (ergonomic) design, n color that reminds me of those magnificent pieces  of blown glass art!! CANT BEAT THIS!!It’s so easy to clean it. Great size to fit in bottle pockets"
74,Desy,"Beautiful but as others have mentioned, Fragile!!!!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Purchased this less than a year ago from Amazon, and when I used it at work, I got many compliments and attention because it was such a beautifully crafted vessel. Unfortunately, one morning as I was exiting my car, it fell, and a plastic hook on the cap cracked off. I was so put off!! Granted it was my fault it broke, but one fall = breakage makes me wish I didn't spend 30 bucks on a glorified piece of plastic!You're pretty much paying for the aesthetic design on this one - 

NALGENE Tritan Wide Mouth BPA-Free Water Bottle

   are much cheaper, and has stood the test of time when it comes to durability."
75,Jesse Lowe,"looks great, but not exceptionally durable, potential design issues and defective from the box but still cool.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had to return mine because it had a crack at the hinge right out of the box. I didn't notice the funny smell out taste some reviews mention, but the construction needs some improvement for me to consider getting one again. Open mouth designs are hard to find with seals so this product is still very cool, but I need durability rather than fashion. It does look really cool and my issues may really be due to defect to I'm raiting it with consideration to the overall experience. If you are gentle on things and like the look it's a great item- kinda sorry I had to return it."
76,Subhaashini,Terrible quality. Its very bulky,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Terrible quality. Its very bulky. The lid is so hard to open.Shipping back costs SG$70. It's so badly made, I can't use it. So I have no choice but to trash it.Please spend your money on something better."
77,Ms. Z,Beautiful and convenient,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I get compliments from friends, coworkers, and total strangers about this water bottle.  I have to say that this is a beautiful vessel, and it's made it easier for me to drink water throughout the day. It's very durable as I've dropped it several times on concrete without any leakage or damage to the bottle.  The unique handle makes it very easy to carry around, and it never leaks in my purse or bag.  The opening of the bottle is wide enough for the square ice cubes I have at work, but too small for the cubes from my ice cube tray at home.  Other than that, it's perfect and I recommend it for anyone who's looking for a pretty, sturdy water bottle."
78,Adam,Looks good but not great quality,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its a great looking water bottle but the quality of the product isnt the best. The chrome parts feel like cheap plastic. my bottle fell off a table and cracked and now leaks. for the cost of this water bottle, i was expecting higher quality materials. other than that, the bottle worked fine for me. the smooth spout part was very nice and the customization of the top part was fun, but i wont be buying another one of these overpriced water bottles."
79,MA,Awesome Water Bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love this bottle it has a very unique sleek look to it, I've gotten so many people asking me where I purchased my water bottle...oh and the cute message when you open the lid is a plus.  Just try avoiding wearing lipstick while drinking because it might stain the rubber and the clear plastic gets easily scratched but overall great buy!"
80,Amazon Customer,Locking latch broke after several months use,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Unique looking water bottle; saw it in an Iron Man movie. Great bottle, large water capacity. I was apprehensive about a hinged lid. The bottle lasted for several months, and then one of the two plastic latch lock(?) broke. It is only a matter of time before the second breaks and then the water bottle is useless; it will not latch/ lock closed.  Will be shopping for a screw top bottle, instead."
81,Jdenyoung,Great water bottle.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Great looking bottle that catches attention. No leaks as long as the lid locks properly. Lid catches a little bit on occasion.
82,BigGameDale,Like it kinda...,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Bought two of these.  One for me and one for my fiance.Pros... Large capacity.  Large spout for easy pour. Looks cool.Cons... Too expensive compared to other bottles.  The inspirational message holder doesn't stay pressed in place very well.
83,M. irving,TONY STARK BOTTLE! YES,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  this is the same container tony stark uses in iron man 1 and 2. i love it. the liquid he was drinking was chlorophil. a blood cleanser and detox to remove metals from the body ( mercury, aluminum ) . great container. do not wash the cover in hot water though. the rubber seal can get shapless. but i kept using cold water and a bottle brush and i love it still"
84,Todd A Christy,Perfect water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Perfect water bottle. Sturdy, simple, and elegant. It does its job well, and feels like it will last a long time. I had another one of these and unfortunately lost it. Liked it so much I went back to the well. Worth the extra money. Someone else described it by saying ""If Apple made water bottles, they would look like this..."" That sums the Kor One up nicely."
85,Erik C,"Great bottle, but Cobalt Blue is actually purple...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  First off, I have to say that the bottle itself is great. It's stylish and a lot better looking to carry around than an ordinary water bottle, if you're into that sort of thing, I'm not, but it looks awesome sitting on my desk.The rolled lip makes the bottle very comfortable to drink from and the ergonomic shape makes it very comfortable to hold. It's size won't allow you to put it in any conventional cup holder, but thanks to the locking mechanism and the rubber O-ring on the inside of the lid, your drink, whether it be water or any other kind of cold liquid, is not going anywhere even if the bottle rolls around a bit. The wide-ish mouth also allows you to stick most sized ice cubes in to give your drink that extra freshness.Now, while I do think the bottle is awesome, I do have a couple... not really cons, but things I wasn't really too chuffed about. First off, and sort of unrelated to the bottle itself, the packaging. Amazon didn't do a very good job with the packaging on the product like Kor Water would have done if I bought it direct. The bottle itself is supposed to have a nice polished look and for the most part it does. But because they didn't wrap it in some kind of bubble wrap, the inside of the box did scuff the bottle up in some places. Luckily though, the bottle is dark enough that it's not easily visible at first glance. If you were to buy the ice blue color though, this would definitely be worth the time it would take to send it back.Finally, and like it says in the title of my review. Cobalt Blue isn't actually blue. I've scoured the Kor Water website to find the one that the bottle I received actually looks like, but they don't sell a purple-ish one. So I'm not really sure how they got their image of the bottle looking so blue, but what you get with this one is not like that. From up close the bottle that I have is distinctly purple, from a distance and under certain lighting conditions it does have a blue haze to it.Other than the mentioned issues though, this bottle is a really convenient and slick looking bottle as far as bottles go. And... purple with a hint of actual blue isn't that bad.Update: I was just trying to upload a couple pictures of this, but I'm finding out that through some optical allusion or the material that the bottle is made of itself... it looks like a true blue from behind the lens. I'll try my best to capture its true color and upload a good visual representation of the bottle that you would see."
86,Amazon Customer,It's easy to carry and a little bit longer than the ...,4.0 out of 5 stars,  It's easy to carry and a little bit longer than the length from my elbow to my wrist .. Longer than expected but still not heavy .. It isn't as easy to open as people on her were saying it was .. Maybe because I'm weak but all together it's nice
87,Brooke Kotzen,I loved the design of the water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I loved the design of the water bottle. It is very affective and its very convenient to carry around. I would recommend anyone to purchase this item! It holds a lot of water so you don't have the inconvenience of having to keep refilling. Very sleek design and I have received a lot of compliments on it!
88,Philly Gal,You may as well look great while you stay hydrated.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Okay, I get it.  You should not have to pay a fortune for a good water bottle, but I love the KOR ONE.  I have purchased three so far.  I knocked the first one off of a railing and it fell down the stairs and broke.  My bad.  I use the second one every day.  The third was a gift for my mother.  She loves it and has been asking for it forever.  That said, everyone asks about this bottle.  It's very stylish, easy to use and it's just the coolest bottle I've ever seen.  I give it four stars because; 1) like I said, it could be cheaper, 2) I wear lipstick every day and it does transfer from the bottle lip to the rubberized seal on the cap. MAC meet KOR.)  This can be hard to clean because it's a soft rubber. 3) My first one broke, so it's not made for a taking a tumble, although a full flight of stairs would be tough on anything.  So, in summary, KOR ONE is awesome and I will buy more.  There are other colors, which is cool, too."
89,C. Marti,I loved this bottle when I first got it,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I loved this bottle when I first got it, but within a month or two the button to open the top just was as smooth, it started getting more difficult to open. I also don't like how at the top you can pop open the little coin lid to change the saying in the top. I feel like its an unneeded gimmick that will eventually hurt the integrity of the leak proof seal. It is very attactive though and over all I really like it, but for the price, the lid and release mechanism should still be as good as it was on day one."
90,Brian,Great Water Bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I love this water bottle. Large fill mouth and the plastic is very resilient I have dropped it multiple times with no issues. I ordered this and also the one with the filter straw and use both of them constantly. I would buy another one I truly bought it at first due to it being the same water bottle used by Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man 2.
91,JEC,They are kind of fun though. Overall I'm very satisfied with the KOR ...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I previously purchased a KOR water bottle of the same color in Target about five years ago maybe, but they no longer seem to be sold there. This one is almost exactly the same, except they now include less ""stones."" However, I suppose the inspirational phrases are not really that integral a part of the ""hydration vessel"" experience. They are kind of fun though.Overall I'm very satisfied with the KOR bottle. It is rather tall, and won't fit comfortably in a cup rest if that's important to you. But, I like the look of its tallness, and usually am carrying it in my (somewhat large) bag. It does look quite nice and holds a goodly amount of water, which is important to me because I like to drink a lot of water throughout the day."
92,Monica Hazel,Not the Kor I have known before,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Previous Kor water bottle purchase was excellent quality so we bought 3 more. All 3 were a disappointment. Appears they changed manufacturer?? Design still cool- but quality lost. Each lid is crooked and does not close completely. It is supposed to be a 1 hand open/close but 2 hands barely does it now.
93,Krystal Stollenwerk,Unique and awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I love this water bottle! The design is unique and I get tons of compliments on it. The opening is big enough to fit ice cubes and I have had no problems cleaning it with a bottle brush. The motivational stones in the top are a fun little addition and the purple color is so pretty! It's just a fun and different water bottle that has quickly become my favorite.
94,Sgt. Slab Wrankle ,Pretty cool stylish bottle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got this bottle because I saw the exact same bottle in iorn man 2. It looks really good. I was expecting it to be bigger but in ounces it's 25 oz big. It's actualy a pretty good size. The price isn't bad despite most claiming its ""to expensive"" I only payed a little over $30 for it which is only $10 more than what I payed for my polar bottle which is 24 oz in size.I love the desighn. The chrome sides really make it stand out. BPA free is good because that means less chance of chemicles ending up in the watter from the bottle keeping the watter clean. It also looks easy to clean when I need to & the opening is big enough for ice.The material feels a bit on the cheap side though. I haven't dropped it yet but wouldn't trust dropping it. The hinge on the lid feels a bit flimsy to. Only a small pin holds together a plastic hinge. For a bottle that was advertised in a movie I would have preferred better quality matereal like glass & maybe real chrome or some kind of chrome plated rust resistant metal but that would make it heavy & increase cost production so that's why it's plastic. Just wish it was at least stronger plastic.It's a good looking high capacity watter bottle over all. I can see why this bottle won awards in design & allot of people like it. I think it was a good buy."
95,Kevin Held,so I don't even feel bad about it,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Let's be real: This is kind of spendy for a water bottle. Or a ""hydration vessel"" as I think they call it.Either way, I used a gift card, so I don't even feel bad about it.  It's a nice water bottle, the closure fits well, a friend is making snarky ""stones"" for me to put in the top instead of the inspiring drivel they decide to print (they're pieces of paper, by the way).It seems to be pretty sturdy. I haven't dropped it on hardwood or concrete yet, though the metallic finish is a little easier to scratch than I would like.It's BPA free so my water is free from nad shriveling contaminates, which I enjoy.  The water does taste fresher than most other water bottles I've used, especially after sitting for some time.  I left it for 3 days in my car and the water tasted fine.  I am what one would call an ""advanced drinker"", and I have yet to put alcohol in it.  As much as I like a stiff drink, I don't want to smell it for eternity.Tl;dr - If it's good enough for Tony Stark, it's good enough for you."
96,Kevin,"It looks great, feels sturdy",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I keep a nalgene at my office and I bought a Kor for home. It looks great, feels sturdy. I love how the bottom has a rubber padding so you don't have to worry about scratching furniture surfaces. The only issue I see is the closing hinge mechanism. I can imagine it breaking further down the line after a lot of use. With my nalgene, I could always buy a replacement cap. Not sure if I could replace the top if I wanted to. I guess time will tell how long it will last. Overall I love the bottle."
97,MD,The choice of Tony Stark...?,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought this as a gift for a huge fan of Ironman, who just really wanted the ""cool"" factor of having the same water bottle used in Ironman 2, out of which Tony Stark was drinking his fancy beverage in hopes to keep his blood poisoning at bay.From that standpoint, it was a massive success -- it is indeed the same product from the film, and so my brother was hugely happy to have the bottle from those scenes, which he'd said so many times he wished he could find.On the surface then, it should get five stars as a movie prop, but, as a water bottle, one might wonder a bit why a bizillionaire would be represented as buying this item, considering he could buy any water bottle on earth....then again, ahahaha, it's a movie so that's a really ridiculous question to pose, since it's fiction.  Clearly, while it's fun to buy stuff that a superhero might have in his house, there's no accounting for choice of product placement in a film, so buying anything from just a glimpse in a movie scene is risky, of course.But, come on, flying suit aside, the Marvel films featuring Ironman do strive for some element of realism in portraying a ""genius, billionaire, philanthropist playboy,"" so one might hope the fictional Tony would showcase a really outstanding ""real world"" water bottle, right?  Then again, he is shown to drive an R8, where someone in his shoes would probably more likely choose something like a Veyron, so maybe expecting this to be the best of the best ""hydration vessel"" was a doomed hope...Anyway, jokes aside on what a comic book hero might buy, as the ultimate water bottle, this one is not so ultimate in real life, according to real life feedback.While my bro loves the movie prop side of it, he does also use it for a water bottle, and noted that its big size makes it a bit clunky, the mouth, while big enough for slimmer sized ice cubes, is not that comfortable to drink out of (too vigorous of a tip back will result in wearing your choice of beverage all over your chin and chest), it tends to hold the odor of whatever you drank, even after repeated washing, and the ""inspirational"" saying plunked under a removable top cap, visible when you pop the lid to take a drink, is a bit cheesy and pointless -- why they even bothered to go to the lengths of designing a lid that holds a pep talk is, to say the least, an odd choice of design, and the cheap paper ones they include (which state either ""be the change"" or ""imagine"") are ridiculously cliche, fail to inspire, and would easily be ruined if they ever got wet, which seems somewhat eventual since it's a water bottle (although, to date, the ""stay dry"" seal has kept them safe from moisture, so applause for at least having a solid design for that strange feature).Even the action of the lid doesn't feel as sure as one would hope, or expect, in a higher priced water bottle -- it doesn't give a satisfying ""click"" into place, and instead you wind up testing the closure a few times, hoping it is fully sealed.  Thankfully, when closed, at least it doesn't leak, but there's not a lot of confidence it will stay shut, due to a front mount locking button that is not at all recessed, and, worse, sticks out a bit far, making it a rather risky set up, since, if bumped wrong at all in transport, or in your bag or wherever, the water bottle lid would fully open and instantly spill the entire contents of the bottle if on its side or upside down, etc.Thus, as purely a water bottle, especially at the price point, this pretentiously named ""Hydration Vessel"" would not be a first choice, or even a tenth choice probably, given what else is available with better value and more user friendly design.The ""Thermos"" brand, for example, offers an excellent pop top insulated stainless steel model with a far superior design, having a screw off top with a much wider mouth for filling it and accommodating fuller sized ice cubes, plus sports a pop top with a small spout for drinking that offers a far superior lid lock element to it that guarantees no accidental spills.Outside of a movie prop item then, this just does not seem to be a hugely well thought out product, but, on the plus side, it is BPA free, so kudos for that, it has a rather clever non-slip bottom to it, courtesy of a rubber ring, seems pretty indestructible in build, does stay closed once closed (although the slightly too exposed lid release button is, as stated, a bit of a worry), it looks pretty cool in a modern sort of way and, hey, it's the water bottle from Ironman, so that's neat, no matter how well it works!As something from a movie for a movie fan, it's five stars -- same product from the film, so a big ""wow"" factor there -- but as a water bottle, it's more like two stars, and that's being generous, so the final tally only limps up to three stars total.If it was solely marketed as a movie prop item (which most folks might not even realize it ever was) for display, it would be a win, but selling it as high priced hydration vessel leaves one disappointed since its real world use as a water bottle fails to impress.Would recommend for a fan of Ironman, as a conversation piece.  Wouldn't recommend for much else -- not the worst water bottle ever made, certainly, but a far cry from being anywhere near the top of the pack.Seems Mr. Stark may well be able to invent a new element for the Periodic Table, but still needs some education when it comes to buying everyday household items..."
98,KLPMAN,WORST SERVICE EVER,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought a KOR bottle almost four months ago. Two weeks later, the rubber seal on the underside of the cap ripped off as I opened the bottle, and it was unusable as it leaked profusely.  I've been waiting over three months for a $2.00 rubber casket that has been on ""back order"", so says the company. Give me a break!! Save your over twenty dollars for a plain water bottle that will cost you less than $10.00! If a company can't supply a necessary part (which shouldn't have failed in the first place) for over three months they should not be in business!"
99,Carlos Diaz,5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I love it & a lot of people always tell me that my water bottle looks cool 😁 this is Tony stark’s water bottle from iron man 2
100,Musiclover_671,Cool Looking Water Bottle the Kor One is!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought the Kor One Hydration Vessel in Ice Blue about half a year ago and let me tell you, it's a gorgeous water bottle! Sure, it's a water bottle that costs twice as much as a ""normal water bottle"" but it's well worth it.It's a sturdy, well built water bottle!I wanted a water bottle that didn't have a twist off top since it seems that I misplace them all the time. The Kor One has a top that is hinged together (no worries for me, lol) and is easily opened with a click of a button. You can even open it with one hand! Good for me since I'm always on my phone!It has a rubber bottom so that it won't slip! People have been saying that since it's an oval-shaped, that it tips over but that is not the case! It has never ""fallen/tipped"" over on me.People have also complain that the water bottle is cheap and fragile. Well yes, if you drop something that is plastic it will break! I have not dropped my Kor One and I have taken care of it! No scratches so far neither! No, I don't agree with people saying it's cheap! It's been about half a year and it still looks new, you just have to take care of it and not just toss it around!Overall, I'am very satisfied with the Kor One! Always getting compliments for the ""cool"" looking water bottle!"
101,Keiko,Piece of Junk,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well, thought this was a great bottle plus it helps the environment but on day 1, it popped out of my backpack's bottle pocket and the handle broke.  Now I'm waiting for the cap to break.  Not worth the price for something so flimsy.  I'm going back to either Nalgene bottles or Camelbak's better bottle.  Great concept and design but poor execution.UPDATE:  Well don't waste $30 on this piece of junk.  Dropped it twice at a height of about 18 inches off the ground and once side of the handle cracked back in March 2010.  Did it again today as it slipped out of my water bottle pocket with bungie cords off my backpack and the handle completely shattered and the lid is crooked that it leaks.  Great design and looks but poor implementation.  For $30 you can get 2 Camelbak better bottles which I dropped from higher distances above the floor and it just bounced and still works great.Well dropped it twice and the cover is misaligned and leaks when closed.  For being environmentally friendly, it's NOT.  It went into the trash can to be incinerated and converted to electricity."
102,Sunnysideup ,MOLD but if you want to keep spending $30 to replace it go ahead.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love the design of the water bottle and it functionality. Unfortunately the rubber circle that touches the opening where we drink from is prone to mold. I’ve tried everything to remove it; a little bit of bleach, distilled white vinegar, dish soap, tea tree oil. Nope :/ I love this water bottle but I don’t want to keep spending $30 each time it becomes undrinkable."
103,Ron Hines,Iron Man's hydration vessel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a fantastic water vessel. It is quite sturdy and well constructed. The design is quite appealing. It is functional and if you are a fan of the Iron Man movies, Tony Stark has this model of KOR water vessel filled with a solution to counteract the damage done to him by Paladium poisioning. That is a big seller for this color and model. It does however has an extreme weakness. The cap will easily break off at the hinges if you drop it. This happened to me. This hydration vessel is not forgiving of accidental dropping. This KOR hydration vessel is the second one I purchased. The first one broke when I dropped it in he kitchen on a linoleum floor."
104,Amazon Customer,Top of the Line,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This water bottle is amazing!  Well made and so much safer for kids.  My daughter loves it and can't wait to use it for school.
105,DN,this is super modern and well made,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  My wife complained I don't drink enough water so I had to find a water bottle that would stand out from the rest of my co-workers at work.  this is super modern and well made!!! excellent spout size and design!! you can write yourself inspirational messages in the cap.  handle is amazing and secure, no leaks.  love the chrome!!! rubber base is very smart and durable!! great bottle!!!!"
106,A. L. Kinard,LOVE....ummm..not so much.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've got to say, this is a pretty dang sexy water bottle! It feels great in your hands, it's the perfect size to drink out of, I can throw it in my bag and it doesn't leak, and the inspirational sayings in the cap are neat. My only complaint is that the ice cubes made from my trays at home are too big for it, but that is a minor thing.I definitely plan to buy a couple more. Buy one..or two! You won't regret it!EDIT......Ok, not even one month later and I have totally changed my mind. I still think it's sexy to look at, and yes, it is easy to drink from but...The downsides:I like my water COLD. Ice cold. This is not the ideal bottle for ice cubes. I did go and buy the special stick ice cube trays, but it's still a pain.It sweats. A lot.Hard to clean unless you purchase a bottle brush.And finally, it is not as durable as it claims to be. I was having a clumsy day and I dropped it in the parking lot at work. Concrete lot. HUGE crack in the bottle.I went to Costco and bought a 3 pack of the Contigo bottles for half the price of the KOR ONE and half the price the three pack is here at Amazon."
107,George Nassar,Big bottle Poppin,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I am Tony stark...and I approve this bottle.excellent quality worth the price .
108,Miss Gadget lover,Say goodbye to spilled water !,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love this water bottle it is made of very thick plastic and holds plenty of water. You can hold it upside down with water in it and no leaks at all. I got tired of buying cheap $10 water bottles that leaked all over the place when tipped over. Yes, it is expensive but its well worth it. This water bottle is very well made and should last a long time. Some of the features I liked are the rubber bottom, flip open top, carrying handle, and its BPA free. In the long run this will definitely save you from having to buy bottled water that is expensive."
109,Angry_BuddhaDSM,A cool looking bottle!,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The Good and the Bad:1.  It looks awesome.  First bottle I have received compliments on!2.  The lock-back lid is great!3.  Wide opening for ice cubes4.  It was in the movie Iron Man (Which is why I wanted to buy it in the first place)The Bad:1.  Thermal Properties are poor.  Doesn't keep drinks cool very long at all.  Bottle will sweat.Suggestion:Though it may make the bottle a bit larger:  Maybe double-line the bottle for better cooling?
110,Andres Sierra,Waste of money...,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Actually really disappointed in this product. I was very excited to receive this water bottle and sadly when I did receive it I came to find that it had a huge crack in it. It leaks and it just doesn't work. Don't know what happened during the shipping but I am not happy with it. Pretty much wasted my money.
111,avatar136,Lovely to use,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Makes me drink water more.  Easy to carry.  Am concerned that because of the hinge lid it may break easily.
112,SupaDave,Scratches easily,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This product is all show and no performance! The material is a cheap plastic that scratches with ease... By my third workout, this thing looked like it had been through world war 4!! At this price point, I was expecting better... From afar it looks great though LOL"
113,ali,Outstanding design!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I just love these bottles, I have my own sink alkaline water purifier and fill them with that water. I was buying Essential by the case for work but now can dramatically decrease my input to plastic waste. The design is exceptional!"
114,Essie,Pretty,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its beautiful to have, however the handle doesn't feel nice to carry. The grooves inside kinda digs in the skin after holding it more than an hour. I wish they had this color for the other bottle that has a slanted triangle shape handle."
115,Okie Wobbly,This baby works!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This bottle lives up to its promise.  Very pleased all around--design, ease of use, the works.  Thanks!"
116,PM,"Like it a lot, a few things that could be better",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been looking for a while for a safe, reusable, convenient water bottle. I like these a lot, although a few changes could make it perfect (for me).Things I like:- I don't have to worry about toxic chemicals leeching into my water- It doesn't give the water a metallic taste like aluminum bottles- Itas a hinged top, so it has a nicer feel to the mouth than screw-top bottles- It has a non-skid bottom and sides, so it's easier to hold and I don't have to worry about it sliding around- It's attractive!Things that could be improved:- It has an oval shape that doesn't fit into a standard-size cup holder- It's advertised as top-rack dishwasher safe, but it's too tall to fit in the top rack- Because it's hinged, the top is in my face when I'm drinking. I think they could easily redesign the hinge so you could detach the top"
117,iiphotekii,Futuristic style,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been using my bottle all week and I like the style of this bottle. it fits nicely into your hand, its futuristic looking, and the coloring is nice. the only thing i didnt care for is that you need to have small ice cubes, the usual cubes do not fit. other than that, i would purchase another one."
118,A Valero,The best water bottle I've ever had,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Amazing water bottle.After using this water bottle I know this is the only bottle I'll ever useThe shape of the bottle fits greats in my hand and the spout feels great when I drink from it.Drinking water from this bottle is a luxury and makes me want to drink more water !This bottle is a great example of how great product design can create an outstanding experience for the user for something as mundane as a water bottle.
119,lightbearer,not as shiny,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  somewhat disappointed, this is my 4th bottle, first time bought at amazon. not as shiny chrome as my previous 2. this is more matte."
120,beachlife81,Been using this since 2009!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought one in 2009. Loved it. Somehow it broke or got lost several years later. I tried many other water bottles but came back to this one because the design is great.
121,AmazonCustomer,great gift!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Here's the lowdown, the bottle is great looking.  It was a gift for a girl, and she seems to love it because she uses it all the time.  When it arrived it didn't come in official packaging, just a plastic bag and inside an Amazon box.  (Does Kor normally send it in packaging?)  The bottle is taller and larger seeming than it looks in the pictures but this wasn't bad, just unexpected.  She's gotten lots of admiring comments on the bottle that she told me about, including ""cool"" and ""sexy"".The cap looks like it could break off if you dropped it with the lid open because the hinge isn't very thick but I think a lot of things in life break if you drop them.  The rubberized bottom is nice.  Overall, a little pricey for a water bottle, but as a gift was really great.  I could have bought two nalgenes but I'd rather buy this one bottle as a unique gift.UPDATE:The bottle was dropped a few months later and the cap hinge broke.  I think they have a new version of this now, so maybe that's what you should look for."
122,ER,I wouldn't recommend it.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I am not happy at all with this. I got it late and also it looks like used or maybe was dropped on the floor. It had spots on it and doesn't look like new and also when u open the top it gets stuck. Very disappointed and I order a lot from Amazon and this is the first time I get something bad and rated it 1 star.
123,Mike,It's Perfect!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I wanted a clear bottle that was easy to use and easy to carry. This is a winner, it looks great, fits my GoFiltr inside and I can watch it work all day. So far I'm loving it."
124,F. Bauman,"Attractive. Great vessel, but expensive and flimsy. Poor support.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I hesitated buying this based on the price for what is essentially a plastic, uninsulated bottle.I must say, though, that it is the absolutely best water bottle I have ever used. Something about the way the opening is crafted makes taking a drink so very pleasurable.That's about the end of the positive.Mine tipped over on the counter after about a month of ownership, and the hinge area cracked. This really matters because it is constructed in a way that the hinge is under tension when opened, causing it to crack further, and if the hinge is damaged, it can not seal the opening properly when closed.I tried to ask the company for any help considering how defective the vessel must be to break so easily, but I was told that they would only provide a small discount on buying a new bottle if I ordered one over the phone. Their Twitter ""customer support"" was worthless as well.Don't let all their hippy crap about water awareness fool you. These cheap bottles aren't worth it. The awareness you should have is that you're going to pay a lot for a poorly made product."
125,Mel,This water bottle is amazingly stylish and draws the attention ...,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This water bottle is amazingly stylish and draws the attention of most people who see me drinking from it! The reason I left off one star was because the lid is not actually as secure as I feel it could be. Making it with a twist on and off cap would probably be more beneficial so water wouldn't leak out
126,Janice Lee,"if you are active, do NOT buy this.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this water bottle because my last one kept leaking, and I felt confident with this product after reading so many glowing reviews about its anti-leaking capabilities. Well, it has leaked on more than one occasion but I kept forgiving it...until today. Today I went to the gym and left my bag on the floor with my water bottle, cell phone, and iPod in it. I came back a few minutes later to find the bottle had miraculously opened itself and generously spilled all of its contents all over my electronic devices, which are now relaxing in a bowl of rice.If you just need a water bottle for your office, home, or any place that would not entail a lot of physical activity involving the bottle, go ahead and get it. But if you are like me, and you are rather athletic and you hit the gym a lot, and throw water bottles into a backpack for various activities, I would stick with a traditional twist-top opening bottle to ensure no leakage. This fancy water bottle was nice for a few weeks but ultimately it sucks for anyone with an active lifestyle."
127,rr,Beautiful design.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Beautiful design, but toppled over sometimes."
128,AAA133,Top did not close correctly and WAY too big.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This bottle is like a jug. HUGE jug, so unless you want to carry around an absolutely HUGE vessel (it truly is a vessel), consider ordering the KOR Delta. This one is also extremely hard to hold, since the top is a bit strangely constructed. Also, mine would not close correctly. There are two clasps on either side that are supposed to snap for the top to stay on and one would not snap, so one side would be closed while the other you could clearly see a crack, and hence it would leak."
129,Amazon Customer,Bad design for the price point,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Was looking for a water bottle with sleek design in a flip top style. Looking forward to Kor One based on several online reviews.However, the look and feel is very ""industrial"". Have received multiple comments from people at work at how bulky and unattractive the bottle looks. It does not feel nice to hold and there is a very loud click when you open and close the cap that is mildly annoying.Really wanted to like the bottle, unfortunately am very disappointed with the overall product."
130,Jesse,Large yet not bulky with a stylish appeal !,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This has replaced my stainless steel water bottle that I couldn't live without for many reasons. First, I like the design of this bottle a lot more because of the handle and the way to cap snaps back and stays while you are drinking. Its also a more oval shape which fits in more spaces in my bag than my other water bottle. I love the size and the look of this and will continue to use it for a long time!"
131,SweetSophieSmiles,Beautiful but disappointing.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was very disappointed in this water bottle. Had it for two days bedore the top/cap broke off. Important to note that it is not at all insulated so water doesn't stay cold or even cool.  Also, the base is a bit too wide for standard car cup holders. Other than that, it is elegant, beautiful and has so,e sweet touches like a customizable message inside the lid. I wish that it still worked!! Seems like a $20 reusable water bottle should be a bit more sturdy than a one time use bottle."
132,Anthony Lagambina,Form over Function,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this water bottle because I was looking for a quality item, that valued form and function.  After about 3 months of use, the seal between the bottle and the top where the mouthpiece is separated and if the bottle is tipped, it will leak.  I have never dropped the bottle or mishandled in any way.  This may just be a random defect, or may be a one time thing, but now I have a $30 piece of plastic that cannot preform it's sole purpose, and it is too late to return it.  Something like this should not be disposable."
133,Amazon Customer,Save your money. Buy something cheaper.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Not worth the price in my opinion. Top wouldn’t secure repeatably on one side.  Dropped it and the top shattered. Didn’t last a month before it got slammed in the trash.  Won’t rebuy and wouldn’t recommend.
134,Heather P.,Just ok.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  These seem really cool initially, but they don't keep beverages cold and they sweat.  Also the flip top lid starts to skew a bit after extended use.  For the price it should have been built a bit better.  My husband swears he smells something weird in his even though it's been washed several times.  I purchased a Hydroflask and am much happier with that purchase."
135,Matt Phillips,I love them. They are modern,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my 3rd KOR water bottle. I love them. They are modern, stylish and just feel good. Having said that, I have just 2 complaints about the Cobalt blue. 1, the blue is actually hard to see thru so I always have to hold it up to the light to see how much water is in there and 2, I wish the top could come off like the KOR Delta's. Other than that, it's a great water bottle!"
136,Eric E.,Great-looking bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Beautiful water bottle. No built-in filter, but it is aesthetic and holds a lot."
137,frownyface,worth it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  i didn't want to spend $30 on a water bottle, but i'm glad i did. it's durable, easy to use, and - as much as i thought it was a stupid gimmick - it DOES feel great to  drink out of. i've tossed it in the back seat of my car, knocked it over on my desk a couple times, still no scratches or any signs of leaking. i read a review that marveled at how it even stays watertight, the silicone lip BARELY touches the rim... i too am at a loss as how to explain it. all i know is that i don't feel bad about spending the $30."
138,David Troy McKenith,Do not lay it Down for no reason it will leak in your bag if you lay you bag down,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I seen this bottle on the movie ironman 2That's why I got it , it looks so so so cool.And it is very cool. But leak proof it is NOT.other than that a great bottle I'm glad I brought it.  And got one for the wife"
139,Stacy R.,Cool style that holds a lot of water,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been purchasing this Kor water bottle for a few years now. I like that the cap is sturdy and doesn't break open if you drop the bottle. I also like the volume of water it holds since I like to drink a lot of water per day. I like the look and style. Throughout the years, the technology of this bottle has gotten better. I haven't had issues with it recently. In the past, it did break easily so I'd have to get a new one all the time but now I'm confident that the quality has gotten better. I get lots of complements on how cool it looks."
140,Charis,Beautiful Water Bottle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love the clear plastic , and design. Very durable and safe around children. It was hard to open at first but once it opened I didnt have a problem reopening it , maybe because it was brand new. But overall a awsome design and will be using it for my hiking trips."
141,Diego Sinclair,"Subtle, Huge -- and Fragile",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  UPDATE:The hinge broke, and it's now not very useful.  The main body is attached to the metal hinge by only a small piece of plastic, which is what broke.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Nicely subtle color.Beautiful form.It's turned out to be a little too big for me to take anywhere, but does help me drink more fluids at home."
142,Amazon Customer,Lid broke on day two,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Beautiful bottle.  Ive wanted it for a couple of years.  Finally invest in one.  Lid broke off on day two.  The hinge is too small for the thickness and size of lid.  Poor design in that aspect.  Too bad:(
143,Drake,Terrific!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have to say that I know a lot of people have some problems, but I LOVE my KOR One.  I haven't had a single problem.  It hasn't leaked at all.  I've thrown it in a bag and it has been knocked around quite a bit so it is showing quite a few scratches and signs of wear, but still works perfectly!  I did break the ring in the top that is used to seal it while cleaning, but was able to buy a new one from KOR for $1 (free shipping!).  All in all I have to say it is the best water bottle I've ever owned.  I love the design (it's beautiful) and it functions great.  I love the fact that I don't have to unscrew a cap and there are no threads to contend with either.  It's great!"
144,pikazz,Awesome water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Very elegant looking water bottle and very practical! Will get another one later!
145,ZZZ ,P*mp cup,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ok so I bought this water bottle because I was tired of walking back and fourth to the water dispenser, it was killing the momentum of my work and I would never know how much water I drank in the day. Now with the KOR ONE, it was a good sturdy handle to carry it. I have to say the lip area where you drink out of is perfect. The angle of how the water just pours in to your mouth is so natural. So now i drink about 3 of these a day at the office. Best part is knowing you got the P*mp bottle in the building."
146,Amazon Customer,Felt poorly made,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It felt very cheap
147,benjamin,Hands Down the best water bottle I've ever owned,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hands Down the best water bottle I've ever owned. It's size is perfect, I drink a lot of water and, this is simply a delight. The shape is great for the quantity of liquid but still feels good in the hand. The mouth piece is like a Gatorade bottle wide but not to wide its wonderful to drink out of. I use it daily and don't have a complaint."
148,Evangeline💋,Just buy it! :),5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Love this water bottle, it's sturdy and I absolutely love the modern design.  It has a rubber grip at the bottom so it doesn't go sliding off my desk. My sister even wants one. The quality is very good."
149,Dr.,Ok,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Ok
150,W. Wise,but these water bottles are crap. They're made in 2 different pieces and when ...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Kor is very friendly, but these water bottles are crap.  They're made in 2 different pieces and when you wash them in the dish washer stuff gets between the bottle and the white part and makes your water bottle looks really nasty - I burned through 4 bottles because of this."
151,Zachary,Not meant for Durability or Dependability.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you want a durable long-lasting water bottle. Turn away. I had this water bottle for maybe a week or so and the latch doesn't fully lock the top cap to the body. So now it's extremely easy  to open just by tugging on the cap to open without pressing the release button. With that said, if this bottle for some reason is knocked over the cap will open and all your water will spill out. I've still stuck with it for some reason but now I have a crack around the back pin of the cap.The only good thing is appearance. It's definitely beautiful and an eye catcher. Which is what you're money is mostly going towards. Not a cent was placed for durability or dependability."
152,Tony,Looks cool but top hinge is so cheap its bound to break.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Product looks great but the hinge when the top hangs is so flimsy its almost just a matter of time before it falls or breaks. Fix that and it should be good but it really makes you wonder how dumb the designers were in the design process.
153,Chris,Very nice bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I would reccommend this to people who like to use water bottles or generally drink water. i wouldn't use it for soda, suger drinks, or juice cause it is annoying to clean.Overtime if you don't wash it the rubber inside the mouth piece when you open it will be a greenish black so clean it or replace it. you can replace at the Kor One website or maybe they have some on Amazon. Overall pretty nice bottle and try not to put coffee or hot water in this it will be hot as if u stuck your hand in hot water. its also good for ice and cold water"
154,M. Young,Beautiful but far from indestructible,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  We bought our daughter one for Christmas because she was obsessed with it. She takes it to school everyday. Her desk was bumped and it fell onto a wooden floor. Now it has a crack that goes about 1/4 away around and leaks. I am not happy about this after spending $30+ for it, and the plastic is not recyclable. I thought these were supposed to be almost indestructible. I've emailed their customer service, we'll see what happens."
155,Kerri,Style and Comfort,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have owned many water bottles before both steel and plastic. This water bottle tops the rest by far. It is not heavy as some report, but it is made with superb quality. The opening is a perfect size (seeing as I tend to dump water on myself with my other wide mouth bottle). It sits very comfortably on your lips and is pleasant to drink from. There is an air tight seal when the cap is snapped into place so there is no worry about leaking. The design fits very comfortably in my hand as well as carrying it on the go. There is a nice rubber ring on the bottom of the bottle that matches with the color that you choose which proves ideal for keeping it on my work desk without slipping. Their website does say they plan on making a custom bottle brush for their bottles, but for now I did buy the OXO Good Grips bottle brush and that works just fine. I find the price to be very reasonable on Amazon since there are other smaller bottles, such as Sigg, that are more expensive and do not have as much comfort as this. Overall, this is a beautiful water bottle that most importantly I love to drink from."
156,Evin Ershock,Brittle stylishness,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I must admit that I really like the bottle. It's stylish and an immediate conversation starter. Proceeds go to good causes and all the while you're feeling good about it.Just don't drop it ever ever. Durability is terrible. I've bought two in the past year: the first one had the latches break on the bottle, rendering it useless, the second one developed a huge crack that runs from the hinge to the top. It's still useful, but for how long? It doesn't leak water quite yet, but  that may happen eventually.I would ultimately say avoid this bottle if you can. The price isn't worth the durability issues and the conversation starters."
157,Amazon Customer,Best I've Ever Had,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  - fabulous looking (of course it's important) - works for hot drinks like coffee and tea without burning my hands (I'm a snob, I brew my own blends of tea all day) - company has good business practices (I heart the earth, I just hate people) - the mouth is easy to drink from, I'm clumsy and I have yet to spill on myself (my shirts are saved) - and now, I don't lose the dratted caps, it's attached for ""busy"" people like meI see complaints in other reviews of breakage but I am pretty hard on mine and I have yet to have an issue. Mine gets carted around in the mesh side pocket of a backpack/laptop case and gets unceremoniously dumped on the the ground a few times a day...it WILL however scuff if mistreated.Gonna have to get a another one for the office."
158,Franny Franklin,Most wonderful bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  My brother gave me one of these years ago, and then it finally broke I was devastated. Luckily, they still sell them online. If I love mine and Iron Man loves his (seriously, this is what he uses in the movie) then it must be a wonderful water bottle."
159,ines loureiro,Beautiful and durable.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Was a gift. My daughter loves it. Stylish and sturdy. Well done.
160,Sandra G,near perfect,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Arrived today and looks like the perfect water bottle for those who are health and ""green"" concerned. Had a fairly large scratch on the front of the bottle in the colored seethrough plastic of the bottle, but I will probably put more wear and tear on it so that should turn out ok."
161,Christine Harada,"but am uncertain It is a beautiful product, and I had received many compliments on ...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I received this product on July 12; and on August 11, not one month later, it broke in 2 ways:a) the plastic part on the hinge for the lid broke off - however, I was still able to continue drinking without the lid flopping into my face when I drank from the bottleb) the entire top part of the bottle came apart (!), resulting in a massive water spill at my desk.  I may be able to fix it with krazy glue, but am uncertainIt is a beautiful product, and I had received many compliments on the product.  Unfortunately, with such a short lifespan I cannot recommend others buy the product"
162,K. James,Awesome Bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  When I read a couple reviews stating this bottle broke easily I was reluctant to order. Now that I have it I love it. I'm so glad I didn't listen to the other reviewer. I've dropped it once and it still works, nothing broke. When I'm out and about and drink from it people wonder what it is. It's stylish to drink from and I love the handle, love the tight closure. Well worth the money."
163,Daniele,"cool, light, pretty solid.. but the cap's hinge feels very fragile",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  As title said.. the bottle looks cool, feels good and solid.Good foot grip, nicely balanced, good plastic finitures.Also the opening fit well the mouth when drinking.And no dripping at all.. that's good.just 4 stars, then, because:the stone cap is easy to lose.. nothing keeps it together with the bottle.. if you loose it, the whole aspect may radically change.Plus.. the cap's hinge feels a little bit too fragile.. each time it ""clips"" open with a click.. i am fraid it's the last time it does it.Still.. i like it."
164,Lisa Clement,Good looking but fragile,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am on my second Kor One and the third for our family.  My first slipped out of my hand and the top broke off.  Sad.  My teenage daughter's lid cracked after about 2 months of use.  She purchased a Kor Delta and the clasp has already broken.Pros of the KOR ONE:-It is handsome-no threads on the drinking spout-easy to open and shutCons:-If the rubber gasket is not perfectly sealed, it will leak (in your purse, in your car)-does not easily fit in a car cup holder-constant fear of breakageWhile I realize it has already paid for itself when you think of what you would spend on disposable bottles, I am keeping my eyes open for a more durable bottle."
165,ElanaAshley,Get the most compliments on this water bottle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have wanted this water bottle for such a long time not only for the charitable benefits but really I loved the design. When I received the bottle I immediately loved my decision to buy it. Im not a pink girl but this pink and the design were in perfect unison. My only complaint was that they stated that they were going to give 4 tabs to put under the cap so when you open there is a word of inspiration 2 they created and 2 blank for you write in whatever you wanted. I only received two and no blank ones for me to fill in, which i really wanted.I have been toting this water bottle around since Ive gotten it. Its sooo easy to use, clean and carry. I love love love it and want to buy more colors. Just kinda pissed about the tabs."
166,Lauren,I do love the design of this bottle when it comes to ...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This bottle began leaking, even when the lid seemed to be perfectly snapped shut and the rubber mechanism on the top of the water bottle was intact. I do love the design of this bottle when it comes to looking great, but it is very awkward to clean and also rather heavy compared to many bottles I have had."
167,Kriss,Very nice bottle.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is such a pleasure to drink from. The lit has a satisfying click and stays open while drinking so it does not hit me in the  face. The mouth of the bottle has a bigger diameter than a plastic water bottle and has a thinner, smooth edge than a plastic cup."
168,Artyom,great product!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  thank you!!! great product!!!
169,Hassan Damerji,Not impressed with quality. Stained.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Not impressed with quality. Stained after several use (see photo).
170,Yuzhou Zhou,This water bottle is large and I love it. I bought it because I am a ...,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This water bottle is large and I love it. I bought it because I am a ironman fan and this water bottle was using by tony stark in the movie Iron Man 2. It has a great look and easy to drink. The shipping is fast. Only took 4 days event the Christmas is coming. I love it!
171,Erin D Kelly,Waste fo $25,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The lid takes two hands to open. The bottle sweats and drips that water everywhere. You can't put in your bag or purse because of the sweat - it soaks everything.
172,Amazon Customer,Well designed bottle.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Too large for daily carry, but a really good design and I will use this for travels for sure.  Will probably buy the smaller one too.  The ""stones"" are rather silly though, a piece of paper with a word on it? um ok lol.  Nice bottle for sure though."
173,EarthFriendlyMomma,Too heavy and doesn't fit any cup-holder,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I liked this bottle because of the easy flip-top however I grew tired of it because it's too heavy to bring everywhere (gym, car, etc) Also it doesn't fit in any cup holder and after a year or so mold grew on the top even though I washed it in the dishwasher every other day."
174,christopher willis,"So far, so good...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought it about 2-3 weeks ago. So far no complaints. Haven't had any issues with cracks or broken pieces after dropping it. It's a good conversation starter. All in all, I'm glad I bought it. Considering purchasing other colors as well."
175,Amazon Customer,Chic and fancy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Super modern and chic bottle water. I got the chrome one, it really looks that fancy and it'll make you want to carry it everywhere. A good purchase. Loved it."
176,kelstown,looks cool but isn't very practical,2.0 out of 5 stars,  looks cool but isn't very practical. The lid is kinda hard to open but at the same time the water leaks out from it sometimes. The cap gets in the way when u go to take a drink and the mouth opening is an awkward size.
177,manjar,nice,5.0 out of 5 stars,  it is very well made
178,User in New York,Not durable at all,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I so wanted to love this water bottle. I got so many compliments in it, and at first it was great. It was easy to open, quiet to drink from, and easy to throw in my bag, since, y'know, it's not supposed to leak. Until the top gets misaligned. After two months only. Never has been in dishwasher, hasn't even been dropped. At the very most, it may have been banged around a little in my bag. It's useless now; I used to be able to wiggle the top a little to make it not leak. Now it always leaks. Waaaaaaayyyy too much money to pay for such poor quality. Don't waste the money."
179,ALBERTO,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Maravilloso. Hermoso. Feliz de comprarlo.
180,ESW,"Great design, execution varies",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ordered the blue one and loved it so much I ordered another in black.  The second proved not as fantastic - this one doesn't latch as well as the first and (like the first) the plastic cap that holds in the gimmicky little paper with ""inspirations"" on it doesn't fit right so the paper gets wet when you wash the bottle."
181,Think_Lodger,"Leaks, poorly made",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The bottle is poorly made - despite the premium price tag, the material is basic plastic. The locking mechanism does not reliably close on both hatches. I already endured a big spill inside of my backpack."
182,Nick DiRamio,"This water bottle is sturdy, beautifully designed and it makes me happy every ...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This water bottle is sturdy, beautifully designed and it makes me happy every time I use it. The handle makes it very convenient to carry and the opening is wide enough for ice cubes, while the rounded edge feels very good on my lips. I get lots of compliments on it."
183,Charlie Gibson,The Ironman of water bottles,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Dope bottle same as tony stark
184,XinoteK,Will turn heads.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  ""Upgraded"" from the Kor Delta even though the Delta has the same capacity and a replaceable lid (unlike this one), wait a minute... But anyway, it has a nice chrome look to it and so far (04/04/14) no peeling or chipping."
185,M. Tomaszewski,Pretty but leaky,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I purchased this bottle because it was something unique. There are a bunch of us at work that have the standard Sigg bottles, and I wanted something that had a little bit of a bigger mouth opening (for ice) and that i could see in. This bottle met 2 of these qualities.I've used it once. I filled it 3/4 of the way full, chucked it into my bag, and left for work. At some point I realized that my leg was wet, and the bottle had leaked. I know that the bottle wasn't totally upside down, and was at most, just on it's side. I'm going to have to do some testing to figure out what conditions make it leak.It's pretty, but not for travel."
186,James,New gym buddie!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Great product over all! Very durable. Make sure you keep the seals aligned. Lock has held it's own being thrown around in the gym bag. Great product overall!
187,lulu,Perfect for grab and go,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not only does this water bottle look as nice in person as it does in the picture, it is just the right size. The see through container allows me to quickly determine the liquid level and to ensure it gets thoroughly cleaned. The flip top is a nice change from the typical screw top of most water bottles because it can easily be opened one-handed."
188,alicia,Mold,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought this water bottle and not long after using it the water bottle lid started to mold.... I do not recommend this product
189,harley2,To much $ for such a delicate bottle.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Extremely easy to break, Dropped 1 time on the mat at the gym (rubber mat!) broke off lid!!! A Lot of money for something that breaks so easily. However looks good"
190,Anne Gamache,Broke quickly,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I loved this waterbottle and it was so cute! But the lid cracked and broke within a few months.
191,ATXguy,Looks Great but BREAKS VERY EASY!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was thrilled when I received this. It didn't leak like my Camelbak, and didn't taste like plastic like my old Nalgene. It looked sharp and I received several compliments on it. I can tell you that since then however, I have discouraged everyone who has considered getting one.The only negatives initially were that it didn't seem to fit in most car cup-holders, and it seemed unstable when filled because of the tall shape. I thought that wasn't a bad trade off at all given the above positives.I read so many reviews about people breaking these easily and I thought to myself that it was probably completely filled and it was clumsily dropped real hard by the person. There's no way a water bottle costing this much breaks that easy. I was wrong. I was in a coffee shop and it was almost completely empty when it tipped over and fell off the table, probably a foot or two off the ground. Then I had to pick up two pieces. It cracked right at the hinge which is just cheap plastic. Now it is no longer leak-proof and is useless with the cracks at the top.I am going to have to go try something else. I really liked this until it broke. I had it for less than two months and treated it so carefully until it broke. From everyone else's reviews, it seems that Kor doesn't do anything in terms of customer service to fix a crappy product. If they do, I'll update this but until then this is definitely the most disappointing product I have ever purchased on Amazon."

194,Victor,I am Iron Man,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Awesome water bottle. It shipped on time and looks great. Not only looks great but it feels great picking up and drink from. All around great product.One small thing though, my cap seems to be a little loose and doesn't stay back as much as it does on the pictures or video. Minor, but it still does stay out of the way when you drink."
195,Lauren S.,Not perfect but way too cool to pass up,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've had three of these, two of them broke in freak accidents involving either a freezer or an awkward fall while strapped into a backpack.  Even with that record I cannot imagine using another water bottle. I get tons of compliments on it and I've never felt so attached to a water bottle in my life."

200,brett,Compliments on a water bottle?,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I get compliments on my water bottle all of the time.  It's easy to clean, fits well in my audi's cupholders, and keeps the water free from debris and secure (doesn't spill even when inverted).Well-made piece of kit."

203,Chad,Excellent! Same as in Iron Man 2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'll be honest. I only bought this because I saw it in Iron Man 2. However I love it so far. I read a lot of complaints in the reviews but from what I see they can all be fixed by visiting the company's website. They sell replacement parts for around $2. They sell new lids, new seals, etc. Great so far, we'll see how it goes with continued usage."

205,M. Fahrer,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Love this product.
206,Dhanashree,Love it! Love it! Love it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am making it clear that I am completely ignoring the fact that the material it's made with is yet to be proven as the best for water bottles. I have been using the bottle for 6 months daily and just love it for its looks, sturdiness and stability. I have had hundreds of compliments for the bottle and may be many of this people actually bought it as well. The best water bottle I have ever had for sure."
207,Andrew J. Konschak,It works for me.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've used this bottle almost exclusively for water. I toss some ice in, and fill it with water for use at work. I've had the bottle for a while now, and it continues to latch without a problem."
208,Shirley Ee,Slightly disappointed with the item,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Delivery is fast,however the bottle is chipped right when I received the item,before I even used it."
209,Em Z.,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Great bottle!! I leave this on my desk at work. Highly recommend
210,Mark Gauen,Bulky,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Its really too big to carry around but it does have a very large capacity to go with that. If your doing multiple different machines at the gym you'll always be looking for a place to put it but if your just getting on the treadmill for a long run its perfect.
211,Victor,I like the design and capacity of the bottle,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like the design and capacity of the bottle, however the mechanism to open and close the lid is flimsy. As a result, I often find myself struggling to open the bottle."
212,marvin_miao,Good,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Pretty good.
213,Paul Carter,"Cool, but not sturdy",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Cool design, but too delicate for active use. Dropped it (empty) on my hardwood floor and now it leaks. If you're a casual user, it'll be fine. If you work out or are physically active, I would suggest Klean Kanteen."
214,Amazon Customer,Beautiful!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Love it!
215,Bi-credit On-line,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  pretty nice water bottle. very conftable to carry on
216,zary5,pretty,5.0 out of 5 stars,  beautiful and slick ! I got so many compliments on my bottle.
217,Tor,glad i bought it,5.0 out of 5 stars,  great looking water bottle. I just wish it were 1 liter. A nice round number is better for calculating water intake.
218,Aldous,"Great bottle, a touch on the fragile side",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Best waterbottle I've owned.Word of caution to those with toddlers. If this bottle is dropped (when full) it's very possible that the plastic latches (that hold it closed) will break. It's not the most durable bottle, but damn... It looks amazing.This is my third one :)"
219,Emily Church,Great product.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a very nice water bottle. It’s unique, attractive, and functional. The spout where you drink is designed to be extremely smooth, a great drinking experience!"
220,RT,five star!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  best water bottle ever
221,David A. Carcelli Jr.,Best water bottle ever!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I mean hydration vessel, which is a way cooler name. By any name, I can honestly say I love this water bottle! It's such a comfortable design, I like to hold it. I bought my Kor vessel as a complement to a my Ice Mountain water cooling unit, and since the day I received it I've had it right next to me every single day. Its so funny that I actually drink more water just because I like using the bottle. Love it. And for ~$20 its well worth it. IMO if you have any interest at all in buying a water bottle, I'd buy this one."
222,Quentin Coldwater,Great and reliable,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  These water bottles are great, everyone loves the way they look and the kids always want to carry them 👍"
223,KevC,Not Happy,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Save your money and buy another water bottle.  Looks nice but due to its narrow shape falls over.  Cap open several times in my gym bag.  Due to its shape fel out of the treadmills holder at the gym and the cap broke.  Bought a Camalbak and been happy with it.
224,Martin Rangel,Great,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Great bottle never leave home without it. 3 stars because mine always leaks from the bottom and leaves my desk wet.
225,Ryan F.,Kor Hydration Vessel,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I love these bottles this is my third or fourth one. In my experience they last several months until the lid or seal starts to break.
226,Van Phu,Fell and broke,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love the design, the color, the function. After dropping it from the top of my washer to the ground, the sides where it is suppose to close down, broke and water keeps leaking so I only use this at home now where it's on a level surface, otherwise water will leak out. I wish it was a little sturdier"
227,reluctant_reader,Great Gift!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  When my boyfriend saw this bottle in the Iron Man 2 movie, he had to have it. So i surprised him on his birthday with this cool looking bottle and he has been using it ever since to drink his water at home and at school. It has been 3.5 months and the bottle still looks great with minor scratches but what can you say, he's a boy. When i got this bottle for him, I was so tempted to buy another one for myself but the bottle is a little on the pricier side. All in all this bottle is great."
228,Amazon Customer,Meh,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Lasted about a week until it cracked. Cracked because I put the lid on too tight....
229,FLcajun,"After a LOT of A+ usage, a small piece ...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  After a LOT of A+ usage, a small piece of the plastic near the hinge broke off which impacted the ability to close the lid tight enough to prevent leaking."
230,Dawn Sok,Two Stars,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Came scratch
231,Kindle Customer,I cannot find an easy replacement part,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I've had the water bottle over a year now and its developing a brown stain on the inner rubber ring. I cannot find an easy replacement part.
232,Tobias L Merriman,it's still useful. Just a really cool looking water bottle is ...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  STOLEN from me by my son. He loves it.  It's starting to leak near the top when it's upside down which is an issue but if you're aware, it's still useful. Just a really cool looking water bottle is all....."
233,Frequent Amazon Customer,Great product! Very stylist,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great product! Very stylist. Beautifully designed. One small drawback, I found it a little awkward to fill the bottle with water since the cap/lid is not removable. I had to make sure the water did not collect in the cap/lid because it would tickle down the side of the water bottle when I closed the cap/lid."
234,Melissa K. Kibler,"Pretty, But Little Substance",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  First, let me write about the pricing. I bought the orange bottle at one price ($26.74, I believe) and then hours later, Amazon changed it to $24.99, then dropped the price further to $23.99 a couple of days after that. I'm not sure why there were so many price drops in such a short period of time.The KOR Hydration Vessel (Really? They call it that? I would hate to be in that board meeting.) is every bit as pretty as the ads and photos suggest. The white plastic is matte and the see-through orange plastic is very appealing. I have a white Macbook with an orange Speck cover and the two match very well. The handle is very functional and, as other users say, the mouth is easy and pleasant to drink from.HOWEVER.I have filled this thing with water twice and both times, I have wound up with water everywhere after the fact. I'm not sure if it's just water that seeped into the crevices and only comes out when I set the bottle on my bed or if there's some sort of leak somewhere, but I can tell you that this is certainly not something I will be tossing into my bag with my Macbook when the bottle is full of water. Additionally, I found the lid difficult to close (not so difficult that I was in tears or anything, but a little more difficult than I was led to believe it would be).In conclusion, I would equate the KOR ONE Hydration Vessel with an airheaded beauty pageant contestant: beautiful and classy, but with little functionality in the real world and prone to bizarre leakage. And I would not trust it near my computer."
235,amber,Not as durable as you may think :/,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I loved my KOR water bottle! I took it with me everywhere and it was perfect for my yoga classes for a quick drink in between flows. I could even insert my yoga mantras into the lid to read with each sip I took.However, after having my bottle for just a few weeks, I dropped it one single time and the top of my bottle shattered into pieces. I am extremely sad and disappointed in the claimed durability of this product."
236,James,Best Water Bottle on the Market!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I love this thing!  It is very sturdy and holds up well to dropping.  I have dropped mine at least 10 times and have never had an issue.  It seals well and never leaks.  It is by far the best water bottle I have ever owned.
237,Lex Latkovski,Great Bottle - Beautiful Design,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This is my all-time favorite bottle. It comes in very handy on plane flights.
238,amzvs,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I received this about a month ago, love it! Everybody compliments me on it how pretty it is. I love the color pink! Fits perfectly in my purse, handle is pretty handy for carrying it around the gym. White one is going to be my next purchase."
239,Jackson West,Dont drop it,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I truly love this water bottle but always afraid of dropping it and sure enough the inevitable happened and I dropped it on the kitchen floor. The bottle is fine but the handle on the top came loose and broke. This was a drop from a height of maybe 3 feet on to a kitchen floor. I agree that this is a wonderful bottle for drinking but are you supposed to not take it anywhere? It's going to get dropped.
240,Jose Martinez,I love this bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love this bottle. As soon as I started using I have been drinking more water and compared to other regular bottles, it just made it a bit more fun. Getting people asking about it at the gym and at work"
241,stamatis kiriakidis,Don't over think it you need this bottle!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I've had many reusable water bottles in my time. From hiking fishing bodybuilding and cycling I've gone threw a lot. This by far is the best if ever had even compared to some very expensive ones. This bottle is the definition of quality!!
242,Haeok Purvis,its just for looks nothing else,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  as for the design there nothing like it, plus it was on iron man 2 when tony stark was drinking water out of it that's why i boughtbut its very fragile if you drop it."
243,cesar gac,"Good product, but looks fragile.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good looking bottle of water,leak proof, but the union of the cap with the bottle seems to fragile,looks like is going to break at any time,but besides that,i think its a good product."
244,Andy d.,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Such an amazing and sleek design, feels somewhat bulky but amazing bottle."
245,Iqwo,"Just two days ago, I picked it up the ...",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just two days ago, I picked it up the top cover separated, the bottom part fell to the floor.I tried putting it back, it didn't work. It broke"
246,Derek Dai,Awesome product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This water bottle is AMAZING. This is my first amazon review. It's the perfect bottle for me with its large volume. It draws attentions everywhere, I've been asked by all my friends where to get it !! Five stars!"
247,Gray,Ups and downs - still with it,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  need to knows:sexy: YESA lil unstable: Yes (don't leave it filled and open standing up it can knock over easily)-2 that affect, I've knocked it around a few times (nothing major) and it's still intact- so for me it's been solid/ also doubles as a weapon in the event u r unarmed and corneredrly big: Yes- so if your thinking cupholder or something you're s.o.l. I LIKE the fact that it's huge (it reminds me to stay hydrated & so i don't leave it places (too often)- or when i do leave it places people just look and go ""what's this?"" giant blue n white thingy?? and nobody goes all ""finders keepers"" on youokay i didn't have time to look through all the reviews to see if this was already mentioned so here i go  several months later after i got it the rubber stopper wouldn't seal properly :(NOOOO -  I spent all this $$$ blahiti blahthen i contacted KOR, they  sent me a new stopper in LESS than 3 days NO charge - fits perfectly-good as new :D they have a 1 year warranty on the bottle so IF there is a prob before u lose yr head, contact them - they can prob take care of it -quickly i might add"
248,Chewy,Nice bottle,4.0 out of 5 stars,  The bottle has a nice feel to it. The bottle opening is big enough for most ice but requires to be hand loaded. The bottle is big enough to hold enough water for a day out.
249,Theiry C.,Four Stars,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Cool product.
250,B Squared,Love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Favorite water bottle ever
251,Diana Michelle Long,Definitely recommended,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought this for my fiancé, he absolutely loves it!"
252,Ginger Dunham,I love it and hate it,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've had 4 KOR ONE bottles!  It's by far the best water bottle I've ever used, but unfortunately it breaks fairly easy.  One drop on a hard surface and it's done...the fancy flip top will break (my last 2 I dropped getting out of my car).  I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't prone to breaking."
253,Dan,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Works really well, doesn't leak at all."
254,Plumeria,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  love everything about this bottle, i regret i did not buy the rose gold color"

257,just a guy,Fantastic product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Although I have bought over one hundred items on Amazon, I rarely take the time to write a review (this is only my third) but this water bottle deserves it.  It really is a fantastic product.Positives:  -Very attractive (I have received countless compliments)  -Secure lid that can be opened with one hand  -Easy to grasp/carry handle  -Rubber footing that resists tipping  -Holds a ton of water  -Wide-mouthed opening  ----Great for adding ice  ----I find I drink more since the water flows faster  ----Easy to cleanNegatives  -None -- seriously"
258,Alex C.,unique,5.0 out of 5 stars,  IRON MAN! thats the only reason i got it and ppl still compliment me on it. great bottle. i know its a little pricey but atleast now i have a bottle no one else has.
259,matthew martinez,Water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Love this iron man had it
260,Rey,Cool and futuristic,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Love the look of this water bottle!!  And a plus for MARVEL movie fans!!
261,JET,Four Stars,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Awesome!
262,Allie J,Great product; horrible pakaging!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like the bottle. Its very sophisticated. great bottle but one of the side panels from the white frame is loose and make a very annoying clicking sound every time i hold the bottle. the really bad thing is that it came in a clear plastic bag! No packaging at all! this bottle is pricy, specially not to have protective packaging."
263,PH,a gift,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I purchased this as a gift for somebody. She put water into it and it didn't leak. She even dropped it several times and it still works.
264,Melanie,Different... in a good way!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was surprised at the size of this bottle when I opened the package.  It's quite ""chunky"".  I expected it to be a little more perfect than it was, but there are some whit-sh plastic-y manufacturing marks on the clear blue section.  Oh well.  I haven't been able to put it down, anyway.  It's very easy to clean.  I like that you can see clearly just how clean it is.  This was a main reason I chose it over others.  It looks pretty cool too and, if you're going to buy it, expect to be asked where you got it from."
265,N.L.T,TONY Stark has this WATER BOTTLE?! NO WAY!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This water bottle is GREAT! Thanks Tony Stark; however, the lid get's in my way when I'm trying to take a sip of it. Also, it gets very heavy carrying it around."
266,reyes,Waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,  first off this is a beautiful water bottle but it's not durable at all and ends up being a waste of 30 bucks. And it fell from my 1 foot high garden table and you would've thought it fell from space. Will not being buying another one i was dumb enough to buy 3 of these.
267,Jmac,New favorite,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I love this waterbottle!! Works well and have gotten a lot of compliments.  The only complaint I had is that the part where you can put an message gets water in it (I just removed the messages as it is not a big deal to me) but for someone who wanted them there it might be a problem.
268,ChrisB,Flimsy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Terrible - dropped it on the first day and it cracked and leaked like crazy. Dropping it was obviously my fault (not covered by the warantee), but I would have expected the material to be a little sturdier for the price. Aesthetically though the bottle is nice and there were a number of well thought out design aspects, such as the rubber ring at the base and the shape of the drinking spout, for what it's worth."
269,Amazon Customer,Stylish but fragile,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This water bottle sure looked great out of the box. It's fun to drink out of, which helps make reaching hydration goals easier. Unfortunately, the plastic hooks that create the seal are very fragile, one broke from simply being knocked over on a table. This is worsened by the fact that the bottom has a non-skid surface, where normal bumps might otherwise slide it an inch, this bottle simply topples over."
270,Court,Best reuseable bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This bottle is great! The mouth size is perfect, not too big that it spills all over your face and not too small that you feel you can not drink it fast enough. The top handle is super convenient, the spill proofness awesome and the under cover affirmations fun and inspiring. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking to not only help save the enviroment but look cool doing it"
271,Naif M.,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Great Product I liked this deal
272,KratosLee,Over priced product.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this because it looks cool in Iron Man 2, but actually the quality isn't match the price, it's just too ""Plastic"". By the way the chrome design will leave finger print a lot."
273,T.G.,KOR. BPA,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought this for my husband and he loves it! Also great price.
274,Danny DiCioccio,Would Not Recommend,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I really love the design. The one thing I can't get past is the plastic smell. It's so strong that it makes you sick when trying to drink out of the bottle. I've washed it 6 times and it hasn't gone away. Also it's horrible at keeping liquids cold, but it wasn't designed for that so that's besides the point."
275,Cathy,Three Stars,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  too big, had to return it"
276,Alton Hallgreen,Cool Design Poor Function,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The bottle looks cool and works well when not traveling with it. The design keeps the bottle from fitting in any cup holders (that I know of). The top doesn't seal correctly sometimes, so it can't be trusted to not leak when placed on its side (since it won't fit in cup holders). Not a good water bottle at all."
277,Souv,Mine broke-in 2 days after a fall,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Sorry, I really liked this bottle on the website and with all the video reviews, went ahead and ordered one. The first couple of things which I didn't like after it was delivered was that it was too long and hence a little unstable but I hoped with the thin rubber lining at the bottom, it wouldn't matter. The second thing was that it didn't fit in any of the cup holders in either German or Japanese cars [which I had access to], my rental American car or even the movie theater. Finally, after 2 days of use, it accidentally fell down as the rubber grip had no affect on a laminate surface in the hotel and broke. It wasn't even that high - about waist length and the bottle was less than half full after the whole days use. After the fall, I realized that there was a crack in the hinges and the bottle didn't close properly any more. tilting it caused water to drain out and carrying it by the handle seemed too risky. The bottle is sturdy and looks good, but if it cant stand one fall and is not even glass, I don't think its worth the money. I read one review in which the person called up the company and they refused to replace the bottle, so I just threw my broken one in the hotel dustbin. I wish I didn't buy it in the first place-wouldn't have felt bad about wasting my $30."
278,Raz,"Bad quality, expensive price",1.0 out of 5 stars,  Cool water bottle but it broke within like 3 months and now leaks everywhere. Definitely not worth the money.
279,Amazon Customer,Rubber cap that covers inspirational badges falls down very often.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The rubber cap that covers the badges on top of the bottle diesnt fit and it falls down every time you carry your bottle with you. I am now using the bottel without the rubber taht covers the inspirational badges
280,ARt,It starts to smell,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Although it is a good looking bottle and works great, after about 2 moths it starts to smell. If you want a bottle that would last you a long time without any smell get a glass one. Amazon has some nice ones for about $20."
281,A. Silva,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Beautiful and functional, I've been drinking more water every day thanks to it."
282,JO,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Great water bottle. Use it everyday.
283,Samuel J. Loeffler,Pretty expensive for a water bottle,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pretty expensive for a water bottle, it's ok, but does the job for a hefty price. I would buy a Nalgene next time for $10 less and made in the USA"
284,Karla Martinez,stylish water,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  this was definitely an impulse buy, after seeing this particular water bottle in ironman I just couldn't stop thinking about it. Its sturdy and the water tastes fine (no after weird taste). The handle at the top comes very handy, I will clip it to my backpack when hiking and the slim effect it perfect for traveling or cup holders in cars."
285,Sarah D,cool bottle,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This is a cool water bottle. It is tall and slim. So it looks like it holds a lot more than it actually does. But it still holds a good amount.
286,Lee,"Sleek, Stylish, and Great Quality",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great looking water bottle, easy to carry around, and excellent quality!  The only ""complaint"" I have, if you want to call it that, is that I can't put ice cubes in it.  That can be easily solved, though, by purchasing an ice cube tray designed for water bottles :)"
287,BackBone,Clean.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Holds a lot of water. I filled this all the way to the very top and did not leak a drop of water. Perfectly made item 5 stars.
288,pkessler,One Star,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Leaks everywhere and falls over easily. Very frustrated.
289,TKDodo,"Pretty, but that is to me the best thing it has going for it",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  First of all, this is probably the most aesthetically pleasing water bottle that I have ever seen, if this factor  is a consideration at all when purchasing such an item. The first couple of  times I used it, everyone was asking me about it, so it has definite merits as a conversation piece. After that, I have to admit that I was not so pleased. I had no use for the pithy little sayings that you can insert into the cap, and cleaning the bottle is a bit of a challenge unless you have appropriate tools to do so. The design was not that functional and is actually rather fragile - I find it too tall and narrow, so when I accidentally knocked it  with my elbow, it tipped over immediately ,rolled off the table, and landed onto a wooden floor about three feet below. The impact was enough to put several cracks in the side of the bottle, and the cap snapped off and smashed into little bits. I have dropped other plastic bottles and none had broken before, much less quite so spectacularly. I would hesitate to say that everyone who drops their bottles will have a similar result, but it was rather surprising.  For the price, however, I was somewhat disappointed."
290,LENA,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love this cute fancy water bottle!~~It doesn't leak at all, please don't use dishwasher."
291,Fra,Doesn't stay closed,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Love the design and drinking from it, but latch stopped working ager only 1-2 months.I am so disappointed because easy to clean and light enough for travel, but when it stopped working it is a nightmare.I can only take it to gym with tape to keep it closed or take it to the office empty.Around the house, I must be careful because if tips over can get everything wet like it did my iPad.I would still try their products, but not with this closure."
292,Andre Luis M Correa,I wanted to love it.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I really wanted to like this. I was anticipating it's arrival everyday. I even talked about it with my gym partner, who thought I was a bit silly for getting excited over a water bottle. But them bottom line is, I didn't like this at all. Didn't even try it. Looked at it, felt sick, and called Amazon to return it.My biggest problem with this: Looks white on the picture but it isn't. It's ""chrome"". Stripper-pole chrome. Nothing against strippers, but it's just not a cool look. I probably held this thing a total of 5 minutes and left enough finger prints on it for the NSA to run a full background on me.This is not a simple design, there are way too many parts for this thing. Think Chevy Malibu. I thought it was going to be more like a Porsche. Yes, water bottles and European sport cars, that's my thing. Don't judge!Any way... I could go on about this thing and how it lacks both quality and function and how it's short comings prompt rants on Amazon review sites. I really should be using my time more efficiently. Scripts don't write themselves, you know.Kor One people, keep working on improving your design. I like your concept. I really want to see it be further developed into something great! I think it can be.  Less parts, make it white and get rid of the ""stones"".All the best.Ps. If you are not obsessed with design and you just want to pay $25 for a water bottle, then I guess this would be okay. Maybe."
293,Shenia Wright,My Fav Water Bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I love this water bottle - it does what it's supposed to and it does it in a beautiful and durable container.It's even better looking in person.I love them so much I'm buying a few more as gifts since all my friends love mine so much :)
294,Ross Herman,silver linings.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  It gets kind of slippery when wet. Mine slipped right out of my hands and shattered. It's BPA free so it won't give you caner, but it can still ruin your day."
295,Saintman42,KOR ONE BPA Free Hydration Vessel Review,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This water bottle is excellent. You will not be disappointed on your purchase. Not only is it a great looking bottle, but it's also practical. Plus, a portion of the profits goes to charity."
296,Jeff Wuerfele,"Great Product, Expensive",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  this is a great water bottle but the price is a little expensive. the lid opens easily but stays sealed when needed. Great looking, great quality."
297,6SeveN1,I love this water bottle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love this water bottle. Saw it in iron man. And now that I actually have it, I am so happy I got it.  It is sturdy and well built."

299,Miss D,Kor Vessel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This product is great.  Love the handle and flip top.  The slim shape makes it easy to insert in tote bag or in car box beteen the seats. Because it is BHA free, I feel safe drinking the water.  Love It, Love It!"
300,Adam,Don't drop it,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a really nice water bottle, however if you drop it the top breaks off and it becomes useless. I've had two of these and the same thing has happened twice. Seems to be due to the small hinge."
301,matt,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  this was a great gift for my boyfriend. a truly high quality product!
302,Roy C,Nice bottle I love it but have one issue with ...,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice bottle I love it but have one issue with it. It does hold the  Liquid inside but when u open the vessel the pressure from the inside blows out the little moisture that is left on the rim onto the cap.

We contacted them, and they agreed to replace it.  After waiting for a few weeks the replacement never came, we contacted them again and they agreed to ship again... guess what, it's now been nearly half a year and we never got anything.

Then after closing the lid after my final sip, one of the hinges broke. Now when it closes it would be partially open on one side. Other than that, it's awesome. Very cool looking bottle.

They didn't even remove the obvious signs of the bottle mold on the sprout and on the inside. Advertising doesn't live up to the deliverable.
385,CK,"Nice looking, but Fragile",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a really nice looking water bottle.I take it to the gym all the time, just handle it with care.Pros:- design is very nice to look at- relatively easy to clean, i just use warm water/dish soap and a little brush to clean the inside- it's clear. being able to see the water is important to me.Cons:- scuff marks. it's not too bad, barely visible. these came from placing it in the water bottle holder on the treadmill and vibrations from it caused the bottle to bounce around slightly causing the marks.- poor balance. because the shape is oval, tall, and skinny, you cant carelessly put it down and expect it to keep standing, especially on those soft exercise mats.- dont ever drop it! because it will break! my lid broke partially after it fell from about 2 feet in the air. one of the little plastic wedges inside the lid snapped off so the lid only closes on one side and now it leaks. i still use the bottle however since i can close it and still hold it by the handles. i just cant put it in my gym bag while there's water inside the bottle."
386,khanh doan,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  it's over the top but I love it
387,D. Cunningham,Looks very fancy,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It looks pretty but the seal at the top can be loosened easily causing water to spill if it's not held upright. The price was high when I bought it.

393,boguz,"All about design, not function",1.0 out of 5 stars,  This is a horrible product. Very hard to open and close. I have to push the button all the way in with one hand and pull on the cap with the other. The hinge is also squeaky. Good design without core functionality is worthless
394,CTNY,Terrible chemical odor,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I never feel the need to write a review but I wanted people to know the problem I had with this. I really liked this bottle until I had been using it for a few months at which point it started to emit a terrible chemical smell. I only ever put water in the bottle and when I contacted the manufacturer, they never even bothered to respond. I will never buy this again and hope others don't encounter this same problem."

402,D. Schultz,Ugly Beneath The Beautiflul Looks,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This water bottle, er, hydration vessel, is possibly the best looking one out there. You will get compliments from people and you'll look pretty cool.Do not buy it.It will not fit in most vehicle cup holders. The shape is more of an oval, not a circle, thus much wider. We have three different vehicles and it will not fit in any of them. It is also very tall in comparison to other mainstream water bottles. A bit clumsy feeling.After having it a few months without any trauma to it, the lid broke in such a way that it would not shut anymore. It happened while my wife was simply carrying it by its handle, and the breaking sloshed water all over her pants as she was walking into work. Sadly, the bottle did not make it out of her work that day... rest in pieces, KOR ONE. Know that you still looked beautiful on your deathbed."
403,hoi ying ng,um...like it but not love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I brother this bottle for school, but it is kinf of too big gor me. Still like it but I will recomment you to buy a 500ml one."
404,Brandon,"Great bottle, easy to break",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Had mine for 2 months before I dropped it getting out of my car. One of the brackets holding the lid snapped off, and it will not longer seal. This is not covered in the warranty, and I am out $30 now. I really like this bottle, and will buy another one if they fix the durability issues, but for now I will stick to my Nalgene."
405,cmack,Broke in less than a month,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I liked this bottle a lot. Hand washed it everyday. I closed the lid after a drink and the two hooks that keep the lid closed snapped off. I sent it back for a refund.

413,Jeff Crooks,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  thanks
414,Joyce Ma,BROKE IN ONE WEEK.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  So I bought this about a week ago, it was great to use. I love the shape of the nozzle and it's awesome to drink out of. HOWEVER, it tipped over on the ground today and the cap opened up and spilled everywhere. I cleaned it up and I realized that it was leaking from the hinge that binds the cap and the bottle together.So if you are super careful and are 100% sure that you will not drop your bottle or even knock it over once, then great! It's an awesome bottle with great aesthetics. But if you are looking for a bottle that will last, this is not the bottle for you. For 20 dollars you can probably buy two longer lasting, not as pretty bottles."
415,Te Tan,Pretty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Beautifully designed, crafted. This feels great in the hands, looks good on your bag, gives you one extra reason to drink!"

418,Aaron Bradford,I loved the way it looked and was really hoping it ...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Seriously don't buy this bottle......its all looks with no durability.  I loved the way it looked and was really hoping it would work out.  One fall broke one of the hooks off that holds the cap firmly in place so water does not leak out when the lid is closed. Now i have to keep it completely upright or water will leak all over the place.  I don't care how many design awards this thing has won, if it cant survive minor slips and falls then its simply not worth buying.  So please look elsewhere."
419,Tian Ying,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The vessel is cool, howwever, the best thing is logistics, it takes only 5 days from US to China."
420,Cutiefrankbird,Wish It Had Been More Durable,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I loved this bottle for the first two months I had it, using it 2-3 times a week during my classes (I teach) and twice-a-week work outs.  Then, the white plastic handle came away from the body on one side.  I guess I dropped it at some point, but I don't remember the fall being anything out of the ordinary.  I finally cracked the whole handle off on purpose so that I could still use the bottle.  So, I have an expensive water bottle without the handy handle, and it looks pretty ratty."
421,Jason C. Ty,KOR ONE BPA Free Hydration Vessel (Ice Blue),4.0 out of 5 stars,  PROs:- Cool design- Construction was well done- Tony Stark use oneCONs:- not spill proof
422,annie,Sleek,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Very sleek looking. The mouth is wide enough for my oblong ice cubes from my ice maker. Wouldn't recommend for rough and tumble use.

427,David Bango,Don't believe the hype...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  After reading some positive reviews on Amazon and other sites and falling victim to the praise being heaped on this water bottle, I took the plunge and spent $30 on the KOR ONE BPA Free Hydration Vessel.  I've had this water bottle for 2 months and I'm not impressed.  The most striking thing when it arrived was the sheer size.  Make no mistake, the bottle is massive and should hold a great deal more water than it's 26 ounce capacity.  I found the bottle to be extremely impractical.  It doesn't fit into a car cup holder and will not fit into the water bottle holder on an elliptical or any other exercise machine.  The construction seems to be pretty fragile overall and the bottle would be very unwieldy for any outdoor activity.  Based on the fact that it's not very portable and cannot be used in the car or at the gym, this bottle has been relegated to being used at home or at the office.  These are places where a glass of water would be sufficient, making this product an expensive mistake with extremely limited use.  Don't believe the hype!  Get a stainless steel water bottle like a Kleen Kanteen and you will be much happier."
428,Andrea Castaneda,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  In love with my new water bottle!
429,Chung-Ah,Just Looks Pretty,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Other than the prettiness of this bottle, there's really nothing special about it. It's bulky and a bit more heavy than my other bottles but it still fits into the side of my backpack. It's also a little too expensive. And I'm not too fond of the little messages in the cap."
430,Jake Schmitz,Amazing quality!!!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This is a great and durable product. It totally meets my expectations. Only down side is that you must have a deep sink to fill it or it won't fit under most sinks.

432,JB,Great water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Great water bottle. I love it. I use a bottle brush to keep it clean and have had no problems.
433,JK,Good bottle,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this for my wife because her Sigg had an interior that was starting to flake away. Pretty gross actually. This bottle is larger, and despite being plastic, very durable. The only problem I have is the lid, it's a hinge design and while it's held up well so far, I have my doubts to it's overall toughness. If your in the market for a water bottle, steer clear of the Sigg and try the KOR."
434,Dylan Sakaria,Four Stars,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Hard to open
435,Claudio Rezende,Disappointing,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bottle looks great, but it does not seal properly and leaks water if not straight up. Also the rubber cover on top of the bottle comes off all the time."
436,Anonymous9324,Frustrated,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought three of these and within a month of purchase one of my KOR ONE Hydration Vessel broke. I am very disappointed because I practically treated my bottles like my babies. It is super heavy (for a bottle), incovenient and the water/liquid inside the bottle does not stay cold at all."

446,Glenn,Too much money,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I found it to be too narrow and tall due to its oval shape.  It looses it's balance very easily.  It does have a rubberized base, but it's just a thin rubber band oval shape.  Very difficult to open with one hand.  I knocked into a table it was on, the ""hydration vessel"" went flying on it's head, the lid broke and never closed again.Who should buy this?  If you must only be seen carrying Coach handbags or wear ridiculously overpriced designer clothes then this is the water bottle for you!"

454,didi,its good,4.0 out of 5 stars,  The bottle is unique. I take it to work everyday.  Sometimes it leaks though. I bought it thinking that it was made out of glass. But it isn't. (I'm looking for a glass water bottle).Its real easy to clean and it looks cool.

464,sharon,KOR Hydration vessel,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is a good bottle - sturdy, wide mouth for ice. Cons: odd shape-doesn't fit into car cup holders; sweats; expensive; the ""stones"" for personal messages are just cheap paper - could easily make them more durable.It has helped us stop buying expensive bottled water."

481,Amanda Fan,DISAPPOINTED,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought two kor one and got them 4 days earlier than expected. The pink one for me and the ice blue one for my husband. I thrilled when got them, because they looked so cool! But when I filled them with water and shook, it's disappointing ! The pink one leaks from the bottom, and the ice blue one leaks from the cap connection part!!! It's obviously not a good gift to celebrate our 6 year's anniversary."
482,fay umbarger,Even better looking than pictured,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This water bottle is great. Easy to drink from, easy to carry. Water doesn't stay cold for a long time, but it doesn't get hot either unless you leave it in the sun. I get a lot of compliments on the look of the bottle. I have the blue tinted one."
483,Lavonde,KOR - Love it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I absolutely love my KOR bottle!  I use it every single day. It holds a lot and is so durable and easy to carry.
484,Ronnie Leonard,Save your money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The lid design is TERRIBLE, the latches are no where near tight enough.  I could practically open the lid without pushing the unlock button.  Not only that but every time it gets knocked over (which is likely because it is so tall) all the water will spill out.  The design is strong in all the wrong places but overall looks cool at least.  The worst part is that I can't exchange it because the plastic covering the hinge broke last night after a knock over."
485,Weaver Jones,Cracked and leaky,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Three weeks after I received my Kor One bottle I accidentaly droped it and the hinge cracked and the top would not seal, so the bottle leaked. I was very happy with the bottle when I first received it, I thought it looked really cool and it functioned very well. But hey thirty dollars is a lot for a water bottle, it should have been a lot sturdier. I went back to my old Nalgene bottle that I have dropped countless times and not a scratch! Dont buy the Kor One, it needs to be built a lot better. The Nalgene is better made and it also is BPA free."
486,Adrian,Looks great. Very fragile.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The bottle looks amazing. It actually looks better in real life than the pictures. Unfortunately those looks come with a price. The handle is not a solid piece with the top, it is held by a little bits of plastic that broke after its first fall from 4 feet. Didn't last a week and that ""lifetime"" warranty is only good for manufacturer's defects."
487,JEREMY,Started off Great..Ending too soon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This product was great in the beginning. Great look, easy to work with, and aesthetically pleasing. Not even a month of having it a plastic screw broke off from it and it seems to be falling apart at the bottles top. I really liked this again from the start...now not so much."
488,Bladerunner,"Nice design, Poor construction/sturdiness.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  A little over one month ago I purchased the Kor one water bottle from Amazon. I paid thirty dollars, a little high but it looks good and BPA free. Last week walking to work bottle fell out of my backpack at about 3 feet off the ground. It hit the pavement and the white piece broke off the bottom and the lid is wobbly and doesn't seal anymore, the bottle leaks when on it's side now. There are no scratches on the bottle, all damage was caused by impact. Seriously, thirty dollars for a water bottle that breaks the first time it's dropped is not worth it. Nice design but not utilitarian."
489,AMMON,i CAN NOT RETURN IT DUE TO AMAZON POLICY TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,1.0 out of 5 stars,  IT IS NOT DESIGNED WELL.DOES NOT CLEAN WELL.i CAN NOT RETURN IT DUE TO AMAZON POLICY TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.
490,b,Just Don't Drop It,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Yeah it looks cool. And it is easy to use to drink large quantities. And Stark used it in Ironman II. But the product is simply not well designed. Sure it looks beautiful and the plastics are nice and durable, but the hinge connecting the lid to the base is to easy to break. It's only as strong as its weakest link.I bought one, dropped it and it broke. I thought it was a fluke. I bought another. Within a week it broke too. Then my wife's broke. $90 worth of water bottles in 3 weeks??? C'mon... My bad."
491,waaasabe,but it would be much better if it was not made in China,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I thought it was a glass bottle, but I was wrong. It's ok, but it would be much better if it was not made in China! I noticed the flip lid was strong when I got it and is now gradually getting looser as I use it. Would also be better if it was a 32 OZ bottle too."
492,D. Sudlow,High hopes dashed after only five weeks...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I dropped this empty bottle from chest height onto a carpeted floor and part of the hinge broke off, rendering it useless.  I can't believe I shelled out so much for a water bottle that only lasted five weeks!  For this price point, I was expecting a well-made sturdy bottle that would last longer than your average water bottle."
493,JT,Kor One,2.0 out of 5 stars,  This bottle worked great and didn't leak for about 6 months. I dropped it 1 time in the kitchen and the whole container cracked down the side. I would not buy this product again.
494,klatoo,One Star,1.0 out of 5 stars,  molded within a few days...thats nasty
495,Luke Wayne Howell,nice bottle but no durability.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  the bottle was nice while it lasted but I dropped it one time and it broke in half, the bottle is nice but not for me. I bought a swell bottle and they are the durable type of bottle I need."
496,Just the facts,Nice looking but..,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Not very practical
497,Wei,It doesn't survive long,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very good looking but hard to fill in ice bricks.  It was dropped off on the floor once by accident, it broke badly.  Quite expensive but my daughter love the design."
498,Zero,Color not as advertised,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Cobalt Blue? Try purple.Only reason why I kept it was because its too much of a hassle to return it and get another.Aside from that the product itself is great.
499,Lily,Looks nice but breaks easily,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The first time I dropped it, it cracked and leaked out all my water. Its a shame because its so cute and I always got compliments."
500,Icarus,Just a cheap repllica. Item not as described.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The item is not as described. It's like a cheap replica. And the color is supposed to fade as you go up from the bottom, this replica does not."
501,Crystal L.,Four Stars,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Wonderful bottle
502,MJONO,Great until I dropped it ONE TIME and it cracked,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great until I dropped it ONE TIME and it cracked, so it is definetly not worth the high cost."
503,tom,very bad product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its one star because I had no option for no stars. Bottle is useless, oval shape and very narrow bottom makes it to tip over every time. This is the only bottle that I saw on the market that is oval with narrow bottom. Very bad design. Does not fit in any of car or bike cup holders. To transport you have to lay it flat on the car seat, constantly looking if its not leaking?I threw my away in the garbage container"
504,Susie K.,"Pretty, Different, Unstable",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This bottle was larger than I thought, which was okay.  It was really different-looking with a sleek design.  It didn't leak in my purse which was great.  I say ""was"" and ""didn't"" because I had it and happily used it daily until it wobbled over one day and the joint/hinge holding the top broke off.  I had it on a bleacher and when some got up, there was a little vibration and it wobbled, tipped over, landed on the ground and broke.  If you look closely at the base of the bottle, it is rounded, meaning it is not very stable.  While there is a rubber ring on the bottom for grip on a slick surface (good) it is not enough to compensate for the rounded base design (bad).  I won't buy another, especially at the high price."
505,Elaine A White,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I love this water bottle!
506,Roy Lyu,Three Stars,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Not as good
507,Jane S,One Star,1.0 out of 5 stars,  THIS IS REALLY HAEVY SMELLY AND TOO BIG. HUGE SIZE.
508,hongmeilv,Four Stars,4.0 out of 5 stars,  It is too big.
509,Michael Lu,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's very beautiful. But too big for me.
510,Lorenzo,Ok,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The product is ok I guess. It hurts my hears because you have to shove them in so they stay. They do block out all noise when you're listening to music. Just wish they went a little louder.
511,Jorge Solis,Great bottle overall,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a nice water bottle, really elegant and didn't ever think I would get so many compliments on a water bottle, even the little message in the cap is nice. I use this water bottle for just about anything from gym to my desk at work so it's filled just about every day, I usually wash it maybe every 4-5 days. I only fill it up with water nothing has ever been in there before, however, the rubber that covers the cap grew a nasty black mold, it is near impossible to take off I tried a lot of home remedies and it made it smell so I cannot use it even more. I always empty it at night and let it dry, of course I'm guilty of leaving it in my car filled overnight a couple times but not to where it's been in the sun full of water for a full week which if I did that then it would be understandable but from regular use to grow that much mold is disappointing."
512,dhersh,Broken after a few months,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I really wanted to love this water bottle. The look is so cool. It made we want to drink water more. I got the blue tint and it made the water look so fresh and desirable. I liked how you could always see the water level and the spout was a great size.However! The hinge closing the lid is horrible. It never felt like it was latched all the way and I had a few spills because of it. The worst thing, I flipped open the lid one day and the hinge totally broke rendering the bottle unusable. I reached out to Kor hoping they would understand but they were punks and said I must have dropped it or something. Total disappointment. I’d go with another bottle if I were you."
513,Bruce Kinsey,"Cool design, terribly poor longevity",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've actually owned two of these, one in Orange right after Iron Man 2 came out. And one in Blue.They're great to look at, they work reasonably well. For a while.It begins with the seal leaking. Nbd, just remove and clean it. A month later, same thing, but this time it doesn't stop. That's when you realize the closure mechanism has gotten weak. So, you start to slam it shut. That works for a minute, but eventually it too quits working.Now you buy another one, years after the first one broke, thinking if it lasts as long as my original one, great! Wrong, the replacement is worse than the last one. Well, wasted that money 😢"
514,Jacob and Kiki Hantla,Excellent Customer Service When I Broke the Bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I received a 750 mL Kor One to review. I received multiple comments on how good looking my water bottle was while I was using it. I like it for a number of reasons:1. BPA Free2. Ergonomic: It is oblong and not round. Thus it fits well in my hand the long way and in my wife's hand the shorter way. The handle on top makes it very easy to pick up and hold when not drinking.3. Secure lid. I had no spills.4. Easy to clean with large pour spout; never had any gross old-water-bottle smells.The problem was that one day, I opened the flip lid, and the lid snapped at the hinge. The plastic simply broke. I'm not certain if this is a design defect with the Kor One and the type of plastic or if I just had a lemon. I suspect that I just had a lemon because the design is so rugged and it feels so solid.I promptly emailed customer service from Kor's website, I was directed to a warranty page where I entered my information with a picture of my bottle. Two days later I was sent a code to order a new, free replacement bottle. Excellent, streamlined customer service and warranty support.Although I received my first Kor One free of charge as a review, I anticipate that I will be ordering another for my wife. They are a bit pricey, but the quality is high, and I love that I am not drinking out of a BPA bottle.  My customer service experience gave me the confidence that the price premium is worth while."
515,Amazon Customer,"Expensive Bottle, Watered down Quality.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  KOR ONE BPA Free 750ml Water Bottle - Used it for about a year, now for the review based on user experience. I purchased this item based on some positive reviews that in my opinion may have been bias as the reviewers may have been compensated for their 5 stars. It’s an Odd shaped water bottle that will not fit in any cup holder.  I had to hold the container between my legs while driving as I do not have an oval shaped car cup holder. When my car brakes at stops, cold water spills between my legs. It has started to leak at the cap, the seal has deteriorated and I cannot lay it down horizontally on my car seat. The container looked clear when new, now it is all scratched up and looks horrible as it scratches very easily. The manufacturer gave it a fancy name ‘Hydration Vessel’ to justify selling an expensive container that holds water.  A water bottle by any other name is still a water bottle."
516,Fry Boy,"Beautiful bottle but, based on KOR's reputation, handle and wash it with care, as you would an iPad . . .",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This water bottle not only has a sexy design but is also BPA free.  While KOR has a mixed reputation in the world of water bottles due to cracking and sealing issues, it does produce one of the more attractive products available.  I've used the bottle for a week so far and have not experienced any leakage issues.  When I received the KOR ONE, I washed it with dishwashing liquid and a sponge.  To date, it has performed as expected.Admittedly, though, there does seem to be overmuch claptrap at the top of the bottle.  There's a rubber oval that you can pull off and insert a ""KOR stone"" into,.  The stone is really nothing more than a piece of round paper with something written on it.  You would place the text of th stone facing downward so that when you flipped open the bottle, you would see some inspirational message like ""YOU'RE THE BEST!"" or ""GO TEAM GO,"" all of which seems rather gimmicky and unnecessary.  In sooth, the rubber oval and its accompanying recess just give you something extra to wash, dry and keep fungus from taking root in.  Not a big deal, but not a highly desired feature either.The bottle is opened by pushing a small plastic button, then flipping the lid on its hinges.  Not sure  how long that's all going to last, but so far, so good.  I'm going to treat the bottle with kid gloves for a while.  A white plastic handle at the top allows you to hook your fingers through for easy carrying.Note that this bottle, due to its oval shape, doesn't fit into my car's cup holder.  FYI, the car is a 2008 Mazda 3s.(BPA, by the way, is ""Bisphenol A,"" a chemical used in some plastics and the inside of cans which has been known to leach into water and/or food.)"
517,penguingrooves,Well-thought design. Won't fit on the top rack of my average dishwasher.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Yes, this is a tall water bottle, measuring almost a foot in height, but that's to be expected for a bottle meant to hold 750 ml (25.3 oz) of water. Don't get it if you want to carry less amount of water. Since it's an oval cylinder, it's wider than circular cylinder bottles but also narrower which allows you to hold it with a more comfortable grip.I'm used to using stainless steel water bottles and didn't realize how handy it was to see the amount of water in the bottle because the plastic material lets you see the content.The hinge mechanism works well, and it's the most brilliant feature of this water bottle because when you push on the button to open, the lid opens and STAYS OPEN while drinking from it. It's truly a one-hand operation - no need to hold the cap or push a lid out of the way to drink. I also appreciate the non-skid bottom. Unlike other reviewers, I haven't had any leaks yet, but the seal is only around the spout inside the lid. Maybe if there was a second level of seal as a safety precaution, there wouldn't be as many complaints about leaks. Or, they could've designed a more reliable seal. Regardless, I don't have a leaky bottle, but perhaps only time will tell. The concept of the entire spout being encased in a lid-chamber is particularly brilliant because the spout area is kept clean.I don't see the purpose of the KOR stone which is just a piece of paper. Does anyone need affirmations whenever they drink water? Accommodating KOR stone only adds an annoying unattached lid which I prefer to not use.The description claims that it's dishwasher-safe on the top rack. I don't know what kind of dishwasher you have, but I have a normal one and not a high-capacity one. It will not fit on the top rack when placed upside-down, which is how it should be placed for optimal cleaning since putting it sideways will collect dishwasher. With the lid open, the ""vessel"" portion is nearly 10"" tall. It barely fits on the bottom rack. Also, with the lid open, it takes up a lot of space because the lid is attached. Unless there are specially designed dishwashers that I'm not aware of, this bottle will not fit on the top rack, so the benefit of easy washing is eliminated.I really, really, really want a top-rack dishwasher-safe bottle designed to fit. Maybe with newer dishwashers that don't have hot coils on the bottom, this bottle can be placed on the taller bottom rack. As long as you recognize the caveat of having to handwash it, the bottle is light, easy to operate and comfortable to hold.UPDATE: The water bottle broke! It's a user fault because someone knocked over my empty water bottle which dropped from countertop height to wooden floor. The hinge broke off, so there's no way to keep the lid on. I'm so bummed! I'm not saying that this is a defect of the product - I'm putting it in my review to let you know to be careful with it, such as not dropping it, especially when it's open. This won't be able to take as much abuse as a stainless water bottle because the hinge mechanism makes it more delicate."
518,Diante,... drinking water or any other beverage that much more fun! I got this particular bottle because it was ...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It makes drinking water or any other beverage that much more fun!  I got this particular bottle because it was the one that was in Iron Man2, so i guess product placement really works!  But after trying it for a few days its a great product especially if you can look pass the $25 price tag.  The cap is built into the design and stays secured until you press the button to open it. The only down side that I could give it is that it doesn't keep the temp of the liquid whether it be hot or cold.  But at that point i'm nitpicking!"
519,John of California and Japan,"More sculpture than function, there is very little good to say about this water bottle design.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have a lot of water bottles, been using them all my life, mainly for cycling and camping, and typically when I'm out and about for the day I'm carrying a bottle of water which I filtered at home.  So I know what I need in a water bottle design.  I've never seen so many useless design features in a water bottle before.Starting from the top, the long winded literature this object comes with claims that the handle is ergonomic.  How?  It doesn't fit nicely as a handle, there's no hook or carabiner. It's actually not very comfortable to hold at all--unless maybe they designed it for a small child, and even then the edges are too sharp to carry it by the handle when the bottle is full.Then just below this attempt at looking space age there is a cap which comes off very easily--it's a completely separate piece which isn't attached to the bottle.  At a glance you might think this is where some kind of accessory or spout would attach, but it's actually a rather huge cover for placing an insert in the cap with a message to inspire you when you take a drink.  The bottle includes inserts saying ""Be the Change"" and ""Imagine.""  I imagine someone owes the estates of Gandhi and John Lennon royalty checks.Then to take a drink, you press a rather small button to unlatch the flip top lid, where you will find a generously sized opening, but no spout or mouthpiece.  You need to pour the water into your mouth, making this bottle useless during active sports or while driving.  In other words, it's purely a pedestrian's bottle.From there on down it's all good except for the shape which wont allow you to insert the bottle into a standard cup holder.  The PBA free plastic doesn't transfer a plastic taste to your water and you can easily see how much water is left in the bottle.  Also, the bottom rim of the bottle has a rubber ring to prevent the bottle from sliding on smooth surfaces.Bottom Line: Useless for drinking from during activities, this bottle is really only good for riding mass transit (maybe) and to have water handy on your desk at work."
520,Snickering,"Functional, fashionable and hydrating",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  When I saw this water bottle I had to have it. I asked for it for christmas, and luckily it was on sale at the time so the price wasn't so crazy.Admittedly it's a lot to pay for a water bottle, but I drink so much more water now that I own this thing. It's sturdy and when closed it will never leak. When the top is flipped back it will never hit you in the face when you have a sip. The handle at the top is incredibly convenient, and even though the bottle is fairly heavy when full, it is pretty easy to carry with just a finger.With the rubbery bottom, it stays standing up and won't leave marks on surfaces. It carries a lot of water and is perfect for long workouts. When I take the smaller coasters out of my car console it fits and it will fit in most fitness equipment with bottle holders. Did I mention the design is awesome?There are only two, tiny things that I would say against the bottle. One, if the bottle is empty and the top is back it will probably tip over. It's easy enough to remember and this is only a minor inconvience if I set it down before handwashing or putting ice in it. Two, for some reason I didn't get my KOR stones with mine. They're not really that important though and are only two bucks."
521,G. Cantor,Form meets function,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This water bottle is well designed, well thought out, well constructed and incredibly elegant.  The loop at the top allows you to carry it around with one finger. It's easy to open, the water flows out of the opening perfectly (the lip is rounded out) and it snaps shut and seals with total ease.  It is made of very high quality plastic that does not impart any taste on the water nor is it porous and thus susceptible to germ absorption.  The white plastic sides lend an easier to grip surface that keeps the clear plastic free of palm prints.  The bottom has a rubber ring that adds a cushion and grips the table. It's made in the USA and they even give a small percentage of their profits to non-profit groups that help with water issues. What more could anyone want from a reusable water bottle?Update: 1/15/09I have read that many people have had their bottles break after dropping them. I have not, although when I've dropped the bottle it has been onto linoleum, carpeted floor and hardwood floor-- not tile or stone.  After quite a few drops, the bottle is unblemished and in perfect condition.I have also read some complaints about the hinged top and how this makes it vulnerable.  While this might be the case, I find that the snap open and snap close ease of this bottle is far better than a screw-on/off top that can easily get lost and takes both hands and time to do.The final criticism I've read is that it does not fit in a car cup holder. This is true but if you want this volume of water, no bottle will fit without being out of proportion (since the bottle would be so tall) so I find this a moot point.  I use it in the car wedged between my seat and the door and find that drinking from it is super easy due to the snap top and big mouth opening.  No eyes or thinking required.As a final note, I received a comment that criticized my claim that this product is made in the USA. It's half-true, as it turns out, and I therefore apologize for the misinformation. This is the response I got from Kor:KOR has partnered with Nypro, one of the largest U.S. manufacturing firms, to produce and assemble our products in their Monterrey, Mexico facility Nypro owns and operates nearly 30 manufacturing plants worldwide.  The facility in Monterrey, Mexico was selected due to its proximity to our warehouse in Southern California, expertise in plastics molding, and ISO 14001 environmental certification.Nypro has been one of our strategic partners from KOR's early stage.--There you have it, my 5 star rating is maintained."
522,Shauna Walker,Fabulous Size and Sleek Design,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  So happy with this KOR water bottle. It has nice design and isn't to bulky to hold or toss in my purse and it never leeks.  The biggest win for me is the spot, I don't like water bottles that have a super huge opening because I am always spilling and I don't like the ones with straws etc because they are hard to clean.  The KOR bottle is just perfect, slightly raised and just the right size. I definitely be buying a few more for the kids."
523,John,These are horrible when you try and drink out of them and ...,1.0 out of 5 stars,  These are horrible when you try and drink out of them and i do have two one for me one for wife. Its like sucking through a real thick milk shake to get any water out of them! Made my wife so dizzy trying to get water out she said this is going in garbage! I had tp laugh so true though. Who wants to go for a run come back for water and have to suck so hard you almost pass out! No stars on this product! Really what a horrible design... Buyer beware.
524,Jasper,Clean Design,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The KOR One BPA Free Hydration Vessel is very space-age looking which is nice.  The bottle holds more water than my other water bottles hold.  This is a good and no so good thing.  Good in that you have more water in one container but bad in that the bottle is heavier because it.  When it is completely filled, it is a little hard for me to hold with just one hand because of some arthritis in my thumb.  The handle at the top is nice for carrying and the lid fits good and tight with no leaks or drips.I was a little hesitant to drink out of it at first for fear that the lid which opens up and folds back would fall and hit me on the nose.  However, the lid is very well made and clicks back and is held securely and will not flop down on your face. They really did an excellent job in designing the bottle.The bottle is well made and looks good."
525,Kasek,New favorite water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was getting tired using my squeeze bottle at work an was looking for something different. It is a little on the tall side but the oval shape is very comfortable to carry and use especially for large handed people. The main thing is it is very easy to open and use one handed which allows me to keep working with out having to stop what I am doing completely. There is a rubber/silicon ring on the bottom so it doesn't slide around, the lid seals great and locks open. The only real gimmicky thing is the kor stone feature which is secured by a rubber plug which can come off if hit just right. It is a little on the pricey side but I will be buying a few more. The durability and quality are nice it doesn't flex or feel flimsy in the hand, I haven't dropped it yet but I think it will do fine from 2ft drops no problem."
526,thundercleese,Overdesigned in just about every way,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've had mine for just over a year now and have found it to be disappointing in just about every important way.First the good:They look very nice when clean and either completely full or empty.The mouth is a good size and is smooth so it feels good to drink from.The recessed rubber foot lends it a nice dampening when setting down and a good grip against general slippage on your desk.Now for the rest:For the capacity these things are gigantic. In the pictures on their web site they look very attractive, but in person they are simply huge. To tall to fit in under the water dispenser on my fridge and too wide to angle under the dispenser and still get water in, also too tall for the water/ice dispenser at work, so I have to keep my old bottle around just to shuttle water from the break room to my desk and then put into this bottle. I only do this because I do trust the materials of this bottle way more than my old free-from-a-vendor nalgene knock-off. If that weren't the case I'd have abandoned this Kor bottle long ago.The ovoid shape of this bottle makes it not fit in any cupholder depsite it's towering height which should mean a smaller diameter. The height also makes it unstable even if it were to fit into a cupholder.The lid is massive and only hinges 180°, so that when the bottle is less than half full you get this giant lid in your face as you try to drink. As you get further to the end of your beverage, the lid can even swing closed and cut  your nose if you aren't careful.As water splashes and evaporates off of different areas inside the bottle, it looks horrible.My seal failed after about 6 months without any trauma happening to the bottle. I've still no idea where it leaks at but only discovered it when driving with the bottle held between my legs one day - because it won't fit in my cupholder - and ending up with a wet crotch after taking a turn.Overuse of materials due to design. These bottles use a lot more plastic than needed for no sake other than looking cool. They should be able to achieve a pleasing appearance while also being kinder about material usage. The side pieces also creak when I hold it, a further flaw of the design.Bottom line, I found it a very disappointing product that seemed to go against all of the stated principals of the company behind it. I only wish I had seen one in person before discovering them in pictures. The sad thing is I've now seen the Kor Vita and like the looks of those as well (at least the 500ml, the 750 looks too tall again), and they seem much more minimalist and usable. But after my experience with these I'm afraid to purchase the Vita until in-person experience, which is highly unlikely. I've still never seen another Kor of any kin in person."
527,Captain Latte,Cool design but a bit pricey,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have actually owned my Kor One since the day they started selling them. Fortunately, mine is still in great condition and I still use it often. The big question most people ask is why pay $30 bucks for one of these when you can get a similar one from Nalgene or Camelbak for $10 (all made of same BPA free Eastman Tritan material -- yep, the stuff that smells after a few days of holding water).The design of the Kor is pretty cool as folks have alluded to in other reviews, but from a practicality point of view, it is just so-so. First off, it doesn't fit in a typical cup holder. Secondly, the vessel is so long and narrow that it doesn't stand easily on its end (a simple shake of the table will tip it over). So you will most often place it lying on its side, which requires you to have a lot of trust that the thing won't leak.One design aspect that stands out is the size of the mouth opening. While it is large enough to allow for ice cubes, it is small enough to avoid typical spilling that you get while drinking from larger mouth bottles such as Nalgenes. BTW, for those of you that want this size mouth opening for your Nalgene and Camelbak bottles, check out Humangear's capCap water bottle top ($6). This brings up another limitation with the Kor One -- everything is self-contained. Since the top is hinged onto the bottle, there is no option to replace it. So while the small mouth opening is nice, it would be ideal to have a replaceable top with something more suitable for working out such as straw or other.I guess I'm a little disappointed that the Kor One folks haven't really done much with their product other than some different color options or new special edition collection with fancy graphics. The original design is still the same. It would be nice to see a smaller bottle. It would be nice to see one that can stand up as well as fit in a cup holder. It would be nice to see different replaceable top/mouth options."
528,Particular Shopper,Great looking PBA free water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This cobalt blue water bottle is not only beautiful in design, but the fact that it is PBA free just sets it apart from the others in its class.  I have a friend who is an art director and she saw my bottle and immediately went online and ordered the same for herself. I hope that tells you how great this design actually is. In addition, it's a healthier way to transport water as it is PBA free!  WIN WIN!  I think you'll love it."
529,Donna,Large enough to keep you hydrate for a long period of time,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The KOR ONE water bottle has the following great features:- I found the KOR ONE water bottle easy to use and hold. I have small hands.- It has stood up well after several runs in the dishwasher, the suction is still functioning as it should.- It durable enough that when I have dropped it a few times and it just bounced. It suffered only a few scuffs but no harm to it's functions.- I like that you can put little messages to yourself in the cap so it's there as a reminder when you drink.The KOR ONE water bottle only had a few downsides:- If the ice being used is larger than a cube, it can be cumbersome getting it in the oval opening.- Can only use water in this bottle. The manufacturer doesn't recommend using anything but water."
530,S,"Looks great, but...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  LISTEN to other reviewers before buying this product! Bottle is poorly made and WILL break upon impact. I received this water bottle (in pink) as a Christmas gift and I loved it immediately. It's really sleek and a good size and gorgeous to look at. It was bigger than I had anticipated too, which is a positive thing. I had seen the reviews about the hinge breaking or the lid cracking when dropped, but I just ignored those-- I never drop anything! Unfortunately, accidents happen, and it fell out of my backpack as I was getting out of my car. It fell about 2-3 feet onto asphalt, and a crack formed on the upper backside where the hinge is. The seal is broken and water gets all over the inside of the cap. It's a beautiful water bottle but very poorly constructed, no water bottle should break that easily, especially one that costs this much. If you decide to get one of these beauties, DON'T EVER DROP IT!"
531,Stefan,"Looks nice, functions horribly",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a classic case of overdesigning something to the point where it doesn't work anymore. It's a beautiful bottle, tall, nice clear plastic, almost space age in style. It's also a pain to open, leaky, and handwash only (it wouldn't fit in a dishwasher anyway, being so ridiculously tall). It states it comes with two ""stones"" to personalize the bottle, which, as far as I can tell, are two pieces of paper that fit into a spot in the (insanely oversized) cap, with inspirational messages. The cap is so tall that the bottle won't fit on your average cabinet/pantry shelf. The whole thing looks cool but is just completely impractical to use. I rarely give anything 1 star, but this one deserves it - sure, it looks cool, but the design choices made it completely useless. Avoid."
532,korova,A nice bottle for non-wilderness uses,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like many things about this Kor water bottle. It is sturdily made and well designed. The cap is permanently attached using a hinge, making the cap impossible to lose. The cap also closes securely yet is easy to open.I won't be using the bottle for wilderness activities such as trekking or camping, though, because it is heavy for its size and the bottle opening is narrow. I prefer using lighter weight bottles with wide mouths for serious outdoor stuff.Bottom line: a fine bottle for daily activities such as commuting, exercising indoors, and working at a desk. For these uses, I prefer the Kor bottle to stainless steel bottles because the cap cannot be lost and the transparent plastic makes it easy to see how much liquid is left in the bottle. Four stars."
533,Carolina Mujica,Gorgeous bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This beautiful water bottle has a great size and capacity for taking it to the gym, and its beautiful blue cobalt color makes it unique and elegant. the cushion on its base avoids it to slip or fall whenever I leave it on top of a table, even if it did, it's pretty resistant. The spout is big enough for me to put some ice inside whenever I want my water cooled up. I love it"
534,John,pretty but not functional,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  this is indeed a beautiful bottle, but that's where the good news stops. i've noticed a trend in eco-friendly products where design trumps functionality and this bottle is just that. i bought one of these a few months ago thinking, ""here is a bottle i will use for the foreseeable future"". alas, it's already broken. plastic is not the most durable material it turns out. i like to freeze my water before i go to bikram yoga and unfortunately some water froze around the lid and caused the clasp to break when i tried to open it. on top of that, i was carrying the bottle around in my bag, before the lid broke, and the push-button clasp came open and spilled water all over my books, good thing i didn't have my cell phone in there... it's a great bottle for looking chic while you drink your water, but if you actually want to do something active it's not the best bet for your money."
535,Leah Berk,"Love it, just wish it held more water...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I use my KOR ONE water bottle all the time. It's a lovely icy blue, and the white accenting makes it look clean and refreshing. The inclusion of KOR Stones (little motivational sayings and images) is a nice touch, and definitely makes it vibe with the new-age, self-care kind of image the bottle itself has. The plastic is sturdy, and it stays clean very well. It ALSO stays closed when tossed in a bag or purse, which is excellent.KOR is wonderful -- its minimalistic designs and charitable contributions both make it a company worth supporting.My major complaint is that it just doesn't hold much water -- I find myself always refilling it, which makes it unsuitable for workouts or anything more than just hanging around my desk to sip on during the day."
536,JAI_,I take this EVERYWHERE ....,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I probably drink 100% more water just by using this. I like that it's aesthetically pleasing. I've received numerous compliments on the design.The top not only snaps shut, but there is also a secondary lock mechanism to ensure it doesn't open when throwing it say in a gym bag.There's the top part of the cap where you can put inspirational quotes or what not, but I find the cap over it comes off easily. It fell off after the first week of use and I don't even know where it is. Doesn't take away from the useability of the bottle though.I take this bottle EVERYWHERE. My only wish is that it were a tad big taller to fit more water. I find myself going back to fill it about 4-5 times a day."
537,Margaret Auld-louie,Loved it until it broke,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I loved drinking from this until it broke and I had to throw it out. The large opening is easy and comfortable to drink from and although it doesn't fit in cupholders, that wasn't a big deal, as you can lay it on its side and it doesn't leak. However, the tall, skinny, oval design makes it easy for it to fall over or be knocked over and if it hits a hard surface, it will break. I had 2 of these and they both cracked near the hinges due to being knocked over. I had one sitting on an end table and my cat leapt up on the table and knocked it off and then the hinge totally broke and the top broke off. So I had to throw it out as it was no longer usable. My remaining one is cracked near the hinge so its days are numbered as well. I just got these last Christmas so they didn't even last a year. At $30/bottle, that's a lot to spend for a bottle that doesn't last."
538,ZenMasterKC,The Holy Grail Has Been Found!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am pretty picky with certain things I buy and water bottles are one of them. I wanted something cool, awesome, and something that made me look like a badass. After a few months of buying different bottles (Nalgene, Camelbak, etc) I came across this bad boy. I could almost taste the pure water pouring out of the comfy spout as I looked at all the different colors. Overall the bottle is pretty damn cool. It reeks of sophistication and high society. I'm not rich, but when I drink from this bottle I sure feel rich. I immediatley removed the KOR Stone out of my bottle upon arrival. I sit on my butt all day at a computer and there was no way I was going to be sipping out my Paris Hilton Hydration Vessel and then on top of that have a mechanic walk by (I work in a maintenance shop) and see some corny message on my bottle. The one I recieved read ""Be The Change"". There are others, but they all mean the same thing pretty much....the Stones might as well read. ""I am picky and bought a $30 water bottle because I had money and was bored.""I gave it four stars because the hinge on the back could be a little beefier. One drop with the lid opened and I'm pretty sure it's going to snap right off like some stale Doritos. Other than that it is pretty cool and I'm almost positive the vessel is making me smarter, stronger, and healthier with each drink."
539,PhotoGraphics,Overpriced and not user friendly,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The KOR ONE BPA Free Hydration Vessel (in other words, plastic water bottle) seems to have been designed by someone with entirely too much time on their hands for someone with entirely too much money in their pocket.  It reeks of ""look at me, I have money to waste on showing off"".  As is true with so many overpriced bling, the bottle itself is poorly designed and not practical.1. The shape is too tall and not easy to hold2. The flip-top lid is awkward and makes actually drinking from the bottle difficult3. The entire bottle, but especially the hinge, are extremely fragile4. The bottle has no insulating properties5. At $26US at the time this was written it is outrageously expensiveRegarding the hinge, it has a tiny piece of plastic on it that appears to serve to try to keep the cap from falling against your lips.  Instead it puts pressure on s tiny metal wire that serves as the hinge pin.  There are only a finite number of times that combination can possible work without breaking.Dumbest of all is some sort of ""stone"" with inspirational messages written on it.  It is really a few pieces of ordinary paper that you are supposed to look at while you're drinking.  They are accessed by a hard to get to, loose fitting rubbery cap.  If you don't remove them while washing the bottle, water drenches the paper thingies, completely destroying them.  Keep in mind; frivolous attempts at cutesy design fads are what you're paying $26 for.Finally, for the outrageous price you would expect to get a presentation box on a par with something an iPad would be packed in right?  Something nice to give this as a gift?  Nope, in fact there is no box at all. The bottle is thrown into a thin plastic envelope without even a piece of tape to hold it shut. That envelope was thrown into a cardboard box without any packing materials when shipped by Amazon. The lack of proper shipping is Amazon's fault but the lack of any box for the product is entirely Kor's fault.My choice for my personal bottle 

Vatiri Handmade Portable Clear Glass Water Bottle, 500ml or 1000ml

   also wasn't cheap but it is attractive, real glass, and you can drink from it just like a real water bottle with no delicate parts to break."
540,Bob L.,I bought this water bottle after being so impressed with ...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this water bottle after being so impressed with the Kor filter system.  This bottle is extremely durable, well made and really well designed. It does not leak, you can wash it in the dishwasher and it it BPA free. If you are concerned with BPAs and plastic in your water (and you should be), this bottle fits the bill and then some. And the blue color is really sleek."
541,karen,A bit pricey but totally worth it..,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought mine about 7mos. ago and i still havent had any problem with it, ive accidentally kicked it numerous times because I place it on the floor beside my bed, I've also dropped it more than twice, i use it all the time especially when i go to the gym, people stare at it and ive had people ask me what it is, when i say it's a water bottle they go ""what does it do?"" Haha, they probably thought it filters water too, lol.. I wash it everytime i use it at the gym so 3times a week, handwash only! .. i never dared put it in the dishwasher.. And until now it's still in good condition.. I would buy again when this one finally gives up on my abuse, i would definitely get the delta next time cause its round and fits on the car cup holder."
542,K. B. Fenner,Wish it were dishwasherable!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Wish it were dishwasher-washable! It takes a whole lot of water to rinse out a handwashed bottle, and getting hot water to the kitchen faucet. Using a dishwasher, as I can with my silicone-sleeved glass water bottles, is efficient and more effective as well. That said, this is lightweight, pretty, though not quite as stunning as the photograph suggests, and easy to drink from. The top snaps back, but does not detach--one-handed drinking is fairly easy. There is a handle built into the top, but that makes the bottle tall for all but one of my fridge shelves. It is BPA=-free Tritan plastic, which, so far, has not been found to be troublesome."
543,Meep,"Clunky and awkward, if aesthetic.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  First of all, the bottle is *gorgeous* in person.  It's comfortable to hold, and the handle is great.  There are tabs you can customize graphics in on the cap, and that's neat (if superficial).The problem is when you open it to drink.  It's very fragile when it's open, and the lid easily snaps off if you drop it when it's open.  Mine cracked badly when, klutzy me, dropped it.  I've bad better luck with glass water bottles, frankly.  For the price it's definitely not worth it, unless you want a nice water bottle for your desk that you probably won't be knocking around much."
544,Mbfar83,Lovely and useful,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love the look and shape of this bottle. Nice spring opening and wide mouth. I love how the company has inspirational messages for you to see every time you take a drink. This is probably one of my favorite features, who couldn’t use a little positivity throughout the day?!! I prefer to use bpa free bottles over expensive, plastic water bottles. I e had plenty of others but these are the features I love about this bottle and brand!"
545,HannahP,Received replacement due to mold- got moldy again!!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm so sick of this water bottle!! This is my second one. The first one the top grew mold. No amount of bleach or other cleaner could get it out. I wrote to the company and they sent me a new one with more specific instructions on how to keep it clean. I followed them to a tee! I cleaned it regularly, I only ever put filtered water in it, and I let it dry out at night as well. And guess what- more mold! And it's in the same exact spot again. This water bottle is great, but they need to fix the issue with the rubber top. Whatever they're using is too porous and letting in bacteria!"
546,chinina,Beautiful but Broken,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  PROS:1.  Beautiful design.CONS:3.  Not insulated.  Won't keep drinks hot or cold and if you use ice cubes, be prepared to deal with condensation dripping down the sides and pooling around the base.2.  I've gone through 3 of these (all of which I purchased).  I'm a sucker for aesthetically pleasing design.  The first one my husband didn't realize it was a flip top and tried to unscrew the cap and broke it off.  Once the cap is broken the whole vessel is useless.  The second time was a simple me putting it on the counter top and due to the combination of having a slight rubberized bottom, the tall and slender build of the water bottle and being half full, the bottle teetered and fell off the counter, cracking the cap, thus rendering it useless.  And it does teeter a lot but I've always been able to catch it/steady it before falling.  The third one I just stopped using because...1.  BPA free does not mean EA (estrogenic activity) free and Eastman Tritan came under fire regarding the latter.  I'm pregnant now and this concerned me.  I wanted to avoid plastic so I bought a glass water bottle (Takeya Classic Glass) but found it to be cumbersome (heavy, fragile, not insulated).  After doing more research I found stainless steel that is light-weight, durable, keeps my water cold all day long without ice and SAFE:  http://www.amazon.com/Under-Armour-Dominate-Insulated-Stainless/dp/B00E6O7CAC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1408039003&sr=8-1&keywords=under+armour+water+bottle"
547,Susie Q.,Has leaked twice,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have to admit that this bottle is attractive and comfortable to hold, unfortunately, I've had a few problems with it. Because of its ergonomic design, I could not get it to fit in a standard cup holder (It's more of an oval in shape than a circle). I have also had it leak from the back (where the lid hinge is) on two different occasions. Both times it was laying flat, hinge side down. It is easy to drink from and easy to fill. I thought the whole inspirational ""stone"" thing was a bit gimicky. It's pretty much just a piece of round paper snapped into the top of the lid.I wasn't super impressed with this water bottle."
548,Massinok,Have to buy something different,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  First off, it's adorable and I received a ton of compliments on it with lots asking where I had purchased the bottle. This was unfortunate because I started having problems with it about ten days in. The top became hard to open occasionally and now after almost three weeks it won't open at all. I'm really disappointed because I absolutely loved the design, the color, the ergonomics. It was wonderful until it wasn't."
549,AmazonShopping,and tried to re-create some of the bad review situations with the complaints,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I just got it in the mail. I tested it out, and tried to re-create some of the bad review situations with the complaints. I haven't tried dropping it, but I left it in a hot car, put it sideways, upside down, and on different types of tables and counters. There's no leakage, and it's working pretty well. The top hinge isn't built all that well, but that's something that's an easy replacement. I see a lot of people complaining about things that happened in the dishwasher. The instructions are really clear that this is a hand-washable item. As far as cracking goes, that happens with most luxury items when they're dropped. It's not shocking. If you want a beater item that you can throw at someone while you're at a gym, or you have a habit of dropping things, get one of those free crap bottles that most companies give out at their lame parties! It probably won't be better for your health, but what the heck, you can drop it and throw it all you want, right? Mine seems pretty durable to me. I punched it hard, and it's fine. I definitely recommend it. For future reference, if it leaks, or there's an issue, it has a warranty/return policy. You can't expect any company to answer immediately after you click ""send"" on an e-mail, Facebook post, or tweet. Be patient. There are replacement parts and accessories found on the websites, ranging from $2.00 to $8.00. Instead of being cheap and/or complaining, if you like the bottle, get off of your behind and go fix it! It's worth it!"
550,Emily Rokke,Beautiful BPA-Free Water Bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love this water bottle! BPA-Free products are really important to me. I also love the color of this water bottle. I would def recommend it and am considering buying more for Christmas presents, that's how much I like it."
551,Amazon Customer,Its a water bottle. Not an epic hydration vessel,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its a water bottle. It holds water and you can drink from it. But if a hipster designer is going all Jony Ive on me and strutting hyperboles like ""epic"", ""reinvention of a water-bottle"", I am going to call BS :)Below are some reasons why this is not water-bottle utopia:1. For folks who claim it took them three years to make it ""beautiful and functional"", it is not really very functional. It is elliptical so doesn't really fit in the cup holder of my car -- I have to leave it on the passenger seat when I take it to the gym.2. The little button that should pop the lid out doesn't pop it all the way to the back. You have to press it and then push it out of your way before you can sip from it.3. It is taller than it needs to be.Over all an OK product that does a good job of holding water. I wouldn't pay 25$ for it."

KOR ONE Water Bottle Onyx, 25.4 Ounce"
554,K. Roman,There are times when plastic is better,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  KOR ONE makes a really nice water bottle. The opening is about 1.5 inches wide. It holds just over 25 ounces (750 ml). It should only be hand washed. I like the little spot to add your favorite saying or inspiration. It has a silicone ring on the bottom to help keep it in place. Ice Blue is blue maybe a little gray-blue. I like to use glass bottles, but there are times like at the gym or at the pool, where glass will not do. The KOR ONE is sturdy and a pleasure to use as a BPA Free Hydration Vessel and if it's good enough for Tony Stark (in Iron Man)... (-;"
555,David Hunter,Stunning Design - Not sure about the Plastic,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  As one reviewer above said, this is the Apple of water bottles. I have had my Kor One now from the very first week these were offered for sell. I use it mostly by my bedside so I haven't had the problems that more active individuals have had with this bottle and it has yet to leak. I do believe in its BPA Free credentials and this is not why I have an issue with the plastic. The only problem I have with this water bottle is that I am constantly having to wash it out and after just a couple of days the water and plastic can develop an undesirable odor and taste. I can definitely see why people buy stainless steel water bottles or just keep water in a glass instead of plastic. Steel and glass just keep water fresher tasting for longer. I wish Kor could pair up with a glass company such as Corning and make an unbreakable glass bottle but then again, I am sure it would be even more expensive. I give the Kor One 5 stars for design but, in the end, I have to rate this as a water bottle; 3 stars.I have had this bottle for more than a year longer than the above review. I have now downgraded my review to just 1 star. The taste of the water is just not neutral. I taste the plastic with every sip and this can not be good for your health. In fact, I am beginning to think that this water bottle is downright dangerous.  My bottle is always clean and I keep nothing but water in it. I wash the bottle with dishwashing soap every few days but I still can not get the plastic smell and taste out of the bottle. Are there cancer causing carcenogens in this plastic?  Even though it is adverstised as being BPA Free, is there no forthright information stating what other chemicals were used in making the Kor One?  I believe that the Kor One is a dangerous product and should be taken off the market. It is a shame. I believe that the design of the Kor One is a design masterpiece. Unfortunately, I also believe it is an manufacturing nightmare. I'm crossing my fingers that I'm wrong. I do not wish for anyone to get terminally ill due to the regular use of plastics."
556,Amazon Customer,Nice to look at but breaks so easily. Not worth it.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very nice design, definitely eye-catching. Problem is just after one day of use, there is already a crack at the hinge. Mind you, I did not drop the bottle, just a small twist when it was open, and pop! A half inch circle of the plastic cracks open from one side of the hinge. Really not happy about spending a significant amount of money on a pretty little lemon.As for warranty, well, I bought this when I went to Singapore and brought it home. So, yeah, guess I'm stuck with this."
557,boost brigade,Ive had mine for more than a year and i still love it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought 2 of these, i have a pink one and i gave the black one to my boyfriend. We use them at the gym all the time and ive never had a problem. the only con to me is that it doesnt fit into the car cup holder, but its not really a big deal because i could throw it in the seat or floor and it doesnt leak and the mouth is covered so it wouldnt get dirty.  And honestly, to the people complaining its hard to clean, its actually very easy for me, i just pour soap inside then shake it then rinse it, its easier than those with water bottles with spout."
558,Slater Lamb,"Looks nice, but has a high center of gravity so ...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  If only the function followed the form. Looks nice, but has a high center of gravity so it tips easily. Not a big deal by itself but it was open when it tipped on my desk and that was enough to break the hinge. Before it was broken, it was hard to tell when it was securely closed and would leak in my bag. When I was careful to close it tightly, I could still get some water to come out by turning upside down and shaking. It is now an expensive dog bowl refill bottle (pitcher?)."
559,Annie D,beautiful but not worth the money,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I received this as a gift from for Christmas and I loved this bottle.  I've had it replaced under the warranty because of the two hinges in the bottle. I've never dropped the bottle and now all it does is leak. I do not stand my Kor One water bottle upright for fear of it falling over(the base is so tiny to support the height of the bottle). It's easy on the eyes but there are other water bottles that are worth this money. I'm extremely cautious with my belongings and I do not throw things around and I clean my bottle regularly, I wanted this water bottle to work but it clearly did not fit the bill.  I considered buying the Delta water vessel to replace the one I have now, but after much research, I plan on purchasing a glass bottle with a silicone sleeve. Glass bottles don't have the smell that plastics do."
560,Bradley Rose,Worst customer service EVER!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love the One and Nava I bought however, they just have not been durable enough. The biggest disappointment is with there customer service, absolutely horrendous. They are so arrogant to think that there product has no issues. they ask you to jump through so many hoops in order for them to actually believe you. And then don't appolagise for the hassle or even muster the courage to appolagise. My bottle leaks, the straw continually un-attaches, and the lid hinge is not strong enough.Also they sent me my Nava without any of the replacement filters and told me there system is ""fool proof"". Once again making the customer out to be wrong and themselves ritious.Again I really like the One and Nava when they work. However, just hope to god u don't have to deal with there compliants dept, as ur in for a long road and an unsatisfactory outcome.Sack the people in coustmer care and have a rethink how u want to treat ur coustmers."
561,Victoria D.,Such a cool bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I got this Water bottle for my husband because he’s so picky with what he drinks out of but he loves this one because it’s a lot like drinking from a cup and not a bottle. The product is very well made and very sheek looking. He loves the way it looks and the design is just super cool. Will most likely be buying another for myself.
562,Troy Edwards,"You're kidding, right?",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Watching the video, they are clearly going for an ""Apple feel"". The guy must have watched Johnny Ives' videos for two months before making his. They convinced one reviewer, but no, this is not the water bottle Apple would design. Apple is all about simple and functional, of which this bottle is neither.The bottle is far larger than it needs to be, doesn't fit in any conventional bottle holder (despite advertising otherwise). And what is up with the inspirational stones?Not recommended for anyone."
563,N7,KOR is the best water bottle I've had!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  First the bad news--I suffer from some kind of obnoxious form of OCD.  Next, the good news! you can benefit from all of the time and money that I have spent reviewing various water bottles and purchasing various water bottles.I have gone through Sigg, Klean Kanteen bottles and a few others.  These ""hydration vessels"" Kor water bottles are my favorite by FAR.  The differences are many. Here are some PROs and Cons:PROs: 1. drinking spout is perfect size (the spout is larger than Sigg and smaller than Klean Kanteen and I love it!--added bonus no thread spout-- so it doesn't feel like you're drinking from the garden hose!)  2. nice size at 11.5"" tall, 3.4"" wide holds 25 ounces (KOR's website mentions that they'll be making larger sizes soon)  3. beautiful--I don't think I can mention this quality enough, I get compliments all the time when I'm out with the bottle, but even better than that I like looking at it so much that I'm drinking more water than ever! It catches the light and looks great on my desk, on the table and everywhere else (ps I have the 2 blue bottles and my wife has 1 green and 1 pink--did I mention we drink a lot of water now?)  4. durable- for us a least, I've noticed some people's reviews saying their bottle isn't and neither of us have dropped ours with or without water (thankfully) but it survives repeated us and travels with us in the car and in bags (mine's in my Timbuk2 messenger bag and hers in her purse) no leaking problems if you don't fill the top hinged part with water. I've dropped and ""destroyed"" the look of 2 Sigg bottles and 1 Klean Kanteen with ugly dents, so whatever bottle you do get don't drop it!  5. secure grip on bottom of bottle--it feels good when you set it down in a secure, this-isn't-going-to-move-around-on-me-way  6. you get to have a fun inspirational message when you flip open the cap!  You get five slips of paper that core calls ""stones"" each one has a different message and one is left blank for you to write on.  7. On their website korwater com you can choose which set of 5 messages you want AND you can get 15% off if you use the code KWS-12574  8. BPA free! Sigg scared me awhile back when they recalled some bottles due to the liner which is a proprietary blend and supposedly have fixed it, but I'm a wee bit paranoid.  9. no metal aftertaste and it doesn't have that plastic cup taste either. I used to only enjoy drinking from glass..until now!  10. Iron Man uses it. In Iron Man 2 Tony Stark uses a KOR bottle, so that's fun!CONs: 1. size- I know I have it as a positive, but it would be nice if there was a slightly larger version and I know there in the process of making it, but..  the current solution that my wife and I use is to get two, which does allow one to chill in the fridge while you drink from the other.  2. water in the top--can be a small nuisance, if you overfill the bottle or refill it with the flip top open toward the faucet it can collect some water and splash/leak that water out when you close it.  The solution--have the cap open to the right side when you fill it up.  3. some condensation can occur after you remove it from the fridge--not a biggie, you drink it, it warms up, condensation goes away.That's all!  So, do yourself a favor and get your new favorite water bottle or bottles!  (or hydration vessels- if you prefer) Just make sure you do it on their website korwater and get your choice of inspirational messages and get 15% off using the KWS-12574 code!Enjoy!!"
564,laurahoo,Wouldn't buy again.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  So I bought two of these through a friend less than a year ago and was super happy when I got them. Mine was pink and pretty and my son's was ""indestructible"" - or so I thought. First, the shape wouldn't fit in any standard water bottle holder at the gym...I have a bigger cup holder in the car that it barely fits into, but I was ok with that and worked around it. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for running...the mouth is much too wide to actually drink while running unless you're really hot and want water all down your chest. Maybe that's the goal? And the shape was a bit awkward to hold while running, but I worked around it...because, after all, I spent a lot of money on this piece of plastic. So after months of minimal use, both of the water bottles cracked right at the hinge. And to top it off, on my son's blue one, the pieces that actually hold the top in place...well those just snapped right off somehow. So his won't even close. Mine will close with some work and sometimes wants to leak. Which is excellent while running so that I can get my legs and arms wet in addition to my chest.So then I call KOR thinking, well these are supposed to last more than a year with minimal use. I'm sure they'll replace them. They told me that I could send them in, at my own expense, and IF they decide that it's a manufacturer defect, they'll replace them. If they don't, then they'll be happy to give me a discount code to by another bottle (um...no). And then I'd get to pay shipping again if I wanted mine back. Isn't that just so nice? Yeah, went to target and got a much cheaper bottle instead that is easy to run with, doesn't leak, AND fits in standard cup holders."
565,Thistle,Nice water bottle with a wacky bonus,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This sleek, elegant, clear blue water bottle has a hinged top that won't get lost because it does not detach.It holds about 25 oz, and has a 1.5 inch opening.The wacky bonus..... inside the cap it has inspirational messages that you can change.It's BPA free, says dishwasher safe on top rack, but I've seen where others had issues with that. I'll stick to hand washing mine.If you're looking for a water bottle that's pretty, well, this is it."
566,K. Barbee,KOR Water Bottle,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  These are nice looking bottles and I really enjoyed using mine every day but mine broke at the 5 month mark. We bought two bottles, my husband is still using his but the top of my bottle broke completely off. I e-mailed customer service twice but have not heard back from them, for the amount of money paid on these I would expect to either hear back from KOR and my bottle lasting more than 5 months. Would not buy again. A friend of mine also bought two KOR bottles and both of hers broke within 4 months as well."
567,Kim,Best water bottle ever!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Why I love my KOR water bottle:1. KOR provides the best customer service I've ever received in my whole life! WHOLE LIFE!  Really.2. And on top of this, this water bottle carries enough water to last me the entire day.3. I never have to worry about harmful chemicals being released into the water since it's BPA free.4. Coolest design ever.  This water bottle is truly unique.  I get compliments all the time, and strangers stop me to ask me where I got my water bottle.5. KOR gives back: a percentage of every purchase goes to support environmental issues.6. I know it's a small detail, but I love the tiny quotes that you can put into the top of the water bottle.  Every time I drink, I get a little pick me up!7. Great, reliable, durable material.  I've never once gotten a crack or any signs of my water bottle breaking down.  And I've had it for 2 years now!8. KOR is famous!  This water bottle showed up in the Iron Man!  Not really why I purchased it, but just throwing it out there as a plus."
568,Amazon Customer,I really liked it initially,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I really liked it initially. It was the perfect size to carry around in the side pocket of my backpack as I went around university. Worked quite well, but within a couple months the white plastic on the bottom started to chip and split. By the end of the school year the white parts around the sides and bottom had completely fallen apart. The blue water bottle part was entirely intact, but there were sharp, jagged pieces of plastic around it. Sadly, it went to the great recycling pit in the sky and I replaced it with a not as nice, but more durable, Klean Kanteen."
569,Daniel Will-Harris,If Apple designed a water bottle...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"   The Kor One ""Hydration Vessel"" has a pretentious name, but it's a beautifully designed product. Easy to carry. Easy to open. Easy to fill. Big enough for ice cubes. Surprisingly heavy duty so it will last. [....]"
570,Steffen GO,Best looking water bottle around,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  my main reason for getting this water bottle was because i needed one.  i had one with a built in straw, and while I loved it I could never get it as clean as i wanted.  Nalgenes are great, but I always seemed to splash water all over my face when drinking out of them.Along came this beautiful water bottle.  I've gotten a TON of compliments on it and people wondering where i got it.  It's BPA free (if you are concerned) and is environmentally friendly.  It would get 5 stars if I didn't need a bottle brush to clean the inside (which wouldn't really be a problem but I sometimes put iced tea in it.)LOVE IT!"
571,DrandomTubas,"Overpriced, awkward, and NOISY",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got this one one of those lightening deals, but I still feel like I paid too much.It's without a doubt the fanciest water bottle I've ever seen... oh wait, I'm sorry... HYDRATION VESSEL, and I got tons of compliments on it, but seriously... it's pretty stupid.The little squishy top section? That's a place to put inspirational comments to yourself. Nothing else. You can even buy them at the website -- keep in mind these are basically sheets of plastic with words on them.It's long and narrow and therefore top-heavy, it requires two hands to open fully... but all of these pale to this issue:the thing SQUEAKS whenever I open or close it. reeeeeeeeeeeiiiit. As a performer, I simply can't have that.It is a very pretty bottle, it's got a nice rubbery bottom, and it doesn't leak."
572,B Baskin-Gilmore,People always ask about my bottle!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love this bottle so much, this one was bought to give as a gift to someone who coveted mine. I have grip issues, and the oval shape and the “handle” make it easier to hold. It’s easy to fill since it’s clear, I love the wide (but not too wide!) mouth. It never leaks, and I pop a love note to myself into the lid!"
573,Watson1313,"Easy to hold, bad lid design, bad color",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Looks great, easy to hold however, the lid is hard to use and feels like it will easily snap off. The color is not green like the picture but just a very faint hint of green."
574,Kendall Marks,Inside Gets Moldy Within a Month,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this water bottle about two months ago, and loved it. However, as soon as a week after my purchase I noticed that the inside cap had a little dark spot on it. I disregarded this, brushing it off. Since then I have been washing my water bottle at least once a week and more and more mold has sprung up. It is truly disgusting, and it won't come off- even when scrubbed rigorously with soap. I would not recommend spending the $30 on this water bottle, I expected much better quality, as I have never had a water bottle mold before."
575,KMH,Best. Holds up,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Had for 1.5 years and used every day. It's great. Just started to leak- probably because I dropped it a million times- I'm here to buy another. Favorite water bottle ever
576,Amy Henke,Poor latch design,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've had two of the green sawgrass bottles. The first one fell over on my desk while open (and empty thank goodness) and the latch arm hit the metal end of a three ring binder and snapped off. I wrote the company and told them that I felt there was a problem since the bottle was only two months old and for that price I felt the design should be more robust. The second one lasted well over a year; but the first time it fell off my desk onto my carpeted floor the latch arm broke off. The problem with this is that the lid isn't repairable or replaceable meaning I now have two lovely bottles that do not close.In addition, the second bottle did leak after several trips through the dishwasher. Again, the seal isn't replaceable so I don't know if this would have solved the problem. If I had paid less than $10 for this bottle I wouldn't be as upset but at this price point, the design should be more durable."
577,Diana,pretty bottle that broke within the first month,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Beautifully designed product, but the latch stopped working and the bottle started leaking within the first month. Customer service was also useless - they wanted me to mail the product back to them. If I'm spending that much money on a water bottle, I expect higher product quality and real customer service."
578,Tenjin,Sexy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The picture doesn't do this justice, this is about as sexy as a water bottle can get!This is truly a functional piece of modern art. The cool blue color, the trendy ""iWhite"" accents and the one-hand open top makes this one a winner. The flip-top means you don't have to worry about the cap and the opening is wide enough to get a decent flow but not too much where you have to worry about overspill. The bottle is oval in shape so it doesn't fit well in cup holders but that's not a problem since it seals tight with a click. The bottle measures 11.36"" and holds 750 ml. You'll drink more water with this and look great doing it!"
579,PM,Horrible design and awkward shape,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this bottle 3 months ago and already it's broken. The part at the top that locks shot has two pieces and both have broken off! I have hand washed these bottles and have taken good care of them. They also have an awkward elliptical shape which is not conducive for using! The shape does not fit in the cup holder in my car and I also can't use it at the gym due to the shape (not able to fit in the cup holders in spin bike or treadmill). I have several ""Intak"" bottles by thermos that I have used daily for 2 years with no problems. I would recommend those bottles over these any day! They are also BPA free."
580,Jane,Love this bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Love this bottle.  Sleep design. Very high quality and durable.  I like that is has more of a flat snap and it comes with the handle, which is easy to carry around."
581,minkhale,"Really, really wanted to love this bottle, but it is flawed",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I loved everything about this bottle for the first ten days, but then the trouble started.  The blue ring became sticky despite washing according to the directions from Kor. (Maybe it didn't like my chapstick?) That, of course, affected the seal and the bottle leaked inside my brand-new, lovely leather purse.  Kor sent me a new ring after I sent several nagging emails. (It took 20 days to get the new ring, even though I live 20 minutes from Kor's corporate office.)  I have never dropped the bottle, but after it fell over in the car yesterday, the lid will no longer snap shut and seal.  (It was leaning against the seat on the floor and tipped over.) My pricey, very cool water bottle is useless after only a few weeks.  Don't waste your money.  Maybe Kor can fix the design flaws and come out with something a bit more durable.  Until then, I will sadly have to use my old, boring water bottle."
582,David C. Cobb,GORGEOUS BUT FLAWED,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I pre-ordered a KOR ONE directly from the Kor website as soon as they were available in 2008, to use around my workplace, at my desk and during meetings. It was as gorgeous as I had hoped, easy to clean, easy to hold, and it stayed beautiful a long time.I had it over a year -- until it fell over, off my desk and onto our office's polished-concrete floor. Thankfully, it was empty, because the hinge and lid shattered into a handful of pieces. Alas, all the beautiful aesthetics in the world can't make up for material or engineering flaws -- perhaps the choice of plastic for Kor is a bit too brittle, and the hinged lid becomes a liability during a fall. I think they should have at least made the lid easily detachable, so it could come apart in a fall, rather than crack the material (unbelievably, the *pin* in the hinge actually sheared in two as well).Add to that, its very tall height and rounded, oval base -- which makes it a tad unstable, empty or full. Simply put, I don't think a water bottle should break after a short two-foot fall onto a hard floor."
583,Researchboy,Poor Quality - Don't Purchase,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I purchased 2 of these item.  The first broke within a few weeks so i got a second one thinking it was just an anomaly.  The second one lasted about as long as the first.  The poor design is related to the locking tabs located on the top of the bottle.  There are two of them and they are very weak. The tips fracture and result in a poor seal at the mouth of the bottle and water leaking.  I recommend going with a different design bottle that doesn't have this locking feature.  Unfortunetly, KOR wouldn't replace it unless I paid for the shipping back to them.  I am sorry, i already tried two of them and will NOT EVER buy another one these water bottles.  Poor customer service."
584,Anna,LOVE THIS WATER BOTTLE!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  LOVE THIS WATER BOTTLE! the handle makes it so easy to carry around- it is so air tight, i was at peace knowing that it won't spill. I love how it looks. Best water bottle. And it's BPA free! So obsessed."
585,UncleJ,Just different shape but same plastic bottle,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Just different shape but same plastic bottle. Triple charges for different shape. Also scamming price (advertise low price and request more money or cancel without notice).
586,lily,seal broke after a year of heavy use,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  i had loved my kor one... i am a teacher so i used it heavily. i put it in our dishwasher frequently and never thought anything of it. but one day the lock just broke off. i tried to glue it back but i wasn't successful. i'm sad! now, after researching, i think i'll buy the Lifefactory glass bottle instead. i loved Kor One's fancy lock and hinged top, but i guess it isn't made to last. it's expensive to have it break so soon!"
587,R. Farmer,"Good, but....",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a water bottle.  It does nothing except store water without introducing unwanted chemicals through contact with plastic.I love this water bottle.  I got mine about 3 weeks ago and it has been extremely sturdy and scratch resistant, and I find that doesn't change the taste of the water the way my last bottle (Nalgene) did. The cap stays firmly secured in the closed position despite the constant jostling of my daily commute into the city, and I have no fear of it spilling at any point.  the Kor stones are kind of lame at first, but you find other things to put in the cap window which actually make it kind of amusing.  I've gotten more than a few comments that it looks like something out of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It would be perfect except that i think it might be a bit large.  I would have ordered a smaller volume bottle had one been available, as this one is a bit tall for its base.  Cleaning it has also proved to be a little tricky because it has such a narrow mouth."
588,lookingforshoes,Great until the plastic around the hinge started to crack after a few weeks,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was so excited for this water bottle and have to admit, I was extremely happy and impressed with my blue KOR bottle! It was lovely to look at and received tons of lookers and compliments in class. I never put it into the dishwasher and never dropped it, but one day I noticed there was a large crack near the hinge. I didn't think much of it until I realized my bottle was leaking when the bottle was completely full or when the bottle got tipped over (when the top was closed, of course). I was very sad this happened, but unfortunately was no longer able to use this bottle :( Hopefully the plastic will get an upgrade (or I'll get a lesson in how to more perfectly handle the KOR)."
589,mjsakura,Cool,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Keep in mind before buying this that it is not sold on outdoor websites or in outdoor stores. This bottle is cool, no other way to say it. It's meant as a way to replace disposable bottles and/or encourage daily hydration. It's not marketed as ""indestructible"" and if you see one in person it's obvious that if YOU drop it YOU will break it (not the company's fault people). Mainly this is a cool everyday water bottle that is great for work, gym, car etc. Just be careful with it (I try not to drop expensive things in general but if I do, it's MY fault). If you want something you can drop all the time, buy a Nalgene, if you want a cool bottle for everyday use, but a KorOne. It does exactly what it's billed to do and it is sooooo coooooool!"
590,Sean L. Lane,Pretty good design -- except that I dropped the bottle ...,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Pretty good design -- except that I dropped the bottle while it was open and it broke right where the flimsy hinge attaches the lid to the container.  Seems like a design oversight.  I won't buy another one.

592,keekee,KOR ONE BPA water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. He says, ""It seals great, easy to fill, easy to carry, perfect amount of water, easy to drink out of.""  I bought it in the ""chrome"" and when it arrived I was surprised how ""shiny"" it was but my husband loved it.  win win."
593,C. Petrone,Loved this water bottle...until it broke!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this water bottle in May and fell in love with it.  Didn't leak, looked great & got tons of compliments, stored a lot of water.  Figured great at work and to tote to gym with me.  I couldn't be any happier after tons of failed water bottles!...and then today I used it at work, no problems.  Then filled it before going to the gym, to see my bag that was sitting next to me in the car was soaked.  Figured I closed the cap wrong and it was my fault.  Then I get into the gym and go to take a sip - notice a crack by the hinge!!!  I didn't even rough house with it, just casual everyday use!I raved about this water bottle to the dozens of people who asked about it and wanted one, now I am just upset I spent $30 to only have it last for THREE months!!  I feel kind of ripped off, very disappointed."
594,t time,DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP BREAKABLE BOTTLE,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been through two of these now. The first lasted me ONLY ONE WEEK, and the other didn't make ONE DAY. The MOST important part of the bottle, the lock, cracked both times. The button also broke, because it was made of the same cheap plastic. The contents of the bottle hinge on both the lock and the button's tiny plastic lips that snap under average usage. Don't waste your time or your money on this product that desperately needs serious revamping of these components before it should be allowed to vend this product. Very unsatisfactory."
595,Deni,"great product, it came even before than expected",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  great product, it came even before than expected.the bottles design is modern and cute at the same time.very easy to use."
596,TrueTashaSnailz,"KOR water bottle, neat and convinent.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This product is great. It is sturdy, convinent, and really neat to look at. Features an easy to carry handle and overall friendly shape. It also has a rubber ring on the bottom to prevent sliding. The mouthpiece is wide and comfortable to drink from. Also BPA free and fairly easy to clean. I read that BPA is a chemical in water bottles that absorbs any other chemicals it comes in contact with, and it can even cause birth defects. I know it's a little pricey, and im not the type to spend a lot on something but i think this is the best water bottle you can get."
597,Marianne,Love the capacity but it leaks,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love the capacity and in the beginning, I loved the handle.  However, I was disappointed that it started leaking after just a few uses.  Now if I lift a full bottle by the handle, the whole lid pops open.  I still use it and have been for several years.  It seems pretty rugged and still looks great."
598,booknerd74,"Meh, save your dollars",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's just a bottle, I don't see any benefits in spending $25 to drink water from it."
599,Sophia T.,"Cleaning isn't the easiest, but simple enough",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you go t the rose gold chrome like me, washing has to be done by hand, not the dishwasher, so it's not the easiest, but it's simple enough."
600,revolution653,Love this bottle!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Love this bottle so much it goes everywhere with me. Can't wait to get more colors.
601,Dinesh,Disappointed,1.0 out of 5 stars,  No. Nothing felt premium. I trusted KORS and felt cheated. I got the chrome version. The cap didn't open up on the first attempt. I had to pull it so hard that the hinge was almost broken.
602,angelfood,Style Meets Function,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Sleek & stylish water bottle, BPA free.Perfect for the office or toting around if you like to make a fashion statement or have an image to uphold. You know who you are.Easy to use and clean. Plastic is not too heavy, not too light, very sturdy."
603,Natureal beauty,Not very durable for the price,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like the design of the bottle, but it is not very durable. I have dropped my bottle and within the first week it had cracked. It is still functional but not what I expected. The seal around the top is getting old. For the price I expected the bottle to be durable and of high quality."
604,Travis,Far too fragile for the price,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've owned two of these bottles. The first one shattered at the hinge after being knocked to the ground. Disappointing, but not completely unreasonable. The second bottle fractured at the hinge. . . after tipping over onto the surface it was sitting on. I enjoy the design, but these are just too fragile for general use."
605,A. Morrow,Great product with over the top propaganda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Note: this is from  review I wrote in October. All of it remains true.  Updates at the bottomI got mine in the mail today and I like it quite a bit more than I thought I would... For starters, the packaging and trimmings are very classy. I know that doesn't matter in the long run, but for me it helps with first impressions. Next off the build quality is really incredible. The base has a low profile rubber ring around it that helps with traction when setting it down. The button on the front to open the lid is large enough and the actual clasp holding it closed is really beefy - actually it's connected to an armature that actuates two hooks - one on each side of the bottle. These, in turn, are held in place by TWO large leaf springs that really feel like they're here to last.What don't I like? Well I hate leaving reviews where I don't trash at least ONE thing about a product but I can't bring myself to do it. OH YA- and the mouth is big enough to put in the ice cubes from my ice maker! See? I actually put a positive comment in the trash section. Ouch.That said, I'm not a paid shill and I --- OH there's something I don't like. I think most of their website is horrible. Too much flash and ""Personal Sustainable Hydration"" is the most pompous tripe I've ever heard.That said, I think everyone should run out and buy one of these, unless you want to die from only having non sustainable hydration! (blech)----December '08 updates:Nothing really much to add... It is easy to keep clean. It will take every ice cube I've found with no problem.  It doesn't hold flavors or smells at all after you've given it a rinse.  The rubber gasket that presses on the mouth from the lid is positively bizarre - it BARELY touches the mouth, yet I've never had a leak that wasn't due to not closing it all the way - and even then only once.It still really looks as good as the day I bought it which is pretty impressive as most things that go into my bag (a Maxpedition Versapack) end up scratched within seconds.  The materials here really are nice.I'm buying 4 as gifts this year, so let that speak for itself."
606,Regina Schaffer,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Arrived quickly and is exactly what we wanted!
607,K. K. Bloom,"Great look, poor design",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Loved the look of this bottle, but it broke within two months of buying it. It fell off of my desk onto a carpeted floor and the plastic around the hinge cracked. I called the company since it was so new. They want me to send it back (at my own expense) to decide if it is a manufacturer flaw. If it isn't then no money. I did not pay $30 for a water bottle to last me two months. That is INSANE. I also would expect better customer service from a company that does charge so much for a simple product."
608,Alex Hu,This water bottle is beautiful than I expected,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This water bottle is beautiful than I expected. Good sealing even I put the bottle in my backpack all day.
609,The Thinker,Unfortunate design defect,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this really cool water bottle so that I would be encouraged to drink more water every day, and my plan worked. Unfortunately, the locking mechanism has many small plastic parts, with each one being necessary to create a leak-proof closure. I dropped the bottle, a tiny plastic piece in the lid broke off, and now the bottle leaks if not fully upright. Kor offered to sell me a new bottle at a $15 discount, but I figure the design is just to iffy. I drop it, a tiny piece breaks and I'm out more money.Also, the sexy shape of the bottle (I really do love this bottle, if only it were sturdier!) doesn't  fit in my car's cup holder. If it didn't leak now that would be fine because I could set it on the passenger seat. My passenger seat has become a mini-lake since the locking mechanism broke."
610,Ingrid,"This bottle breaks. Every time I dropped it, ...",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This bottle breaks.  Every time I dropped it, it broke, eventually just becoming a leaky mess.  I've had several of them.  Very disappointing."

613,Jess,Looks great...Win!  It leaks...FAIL!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Day 1: Pulled it out of the box.  Marveled at its beauty.  Washed it.  Filled it up.  Laid it in the passenger seat of my car (it's too big to stand up in a cup holder).  Picked it up as soon as I saw the water puddle growing under the bottle!  It leaks!!!  I didn't even drop it like all the other one-star reviews claim.  Actually, I hadn't even had a chance to have one sip from it before I noticed it was leaking!FAIL!!But damn, it sure is pretty.UPDATE June 09, 2010:Upgraded review from 1 star to 4 stars.Replaced through Amazon & new bottle is leak-proof! YAY!Thank you for your offer, Paul."
614,A. Hilla,KOR ONE - By Far The Best Water Bottle!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I own both the Anthracite Black & Ice Blue variations of the KOR ONE.  This is by far the best water bottle that I've owned.  Some people complain of the size but you have to realize going into this that it's a 750ml Water Bottle... it's going to be big.  I mainly use it at work and/or around the house.When at work or out hiking people have commented and asked where I got it, everyone loves the wonderful design of this bottle."

616,Susan J. Dunham,Too unstable and top-heavy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've had this for about a month and liked it ok, though I did email the company to suggest that they create a double-walled version since I don't like it when my water bottles sweat, but that's beside the point.  Unfortunately, this bottle is too top-heavy when the lid is opened, and because the bottom is narrow and oval, it's not very sturdy.  It falls easily, and mine just broke and is not reparable.  So now though I was trying to save the environment with my purchase of this water bottle, I now have to add it to the trash going out the door."
617,Nattali,It gets the job done.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is great for school, easy to carry, no issues. If you liked what you saw in Iron Man 2, get this bottle."
618,April M. Steenburgh,Good design,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I enjoyed the handle on the bottle, and it was pleasant and easy to drunk from. It was perfect for long work days. I did drop the bottle once and it cracked. So, excellent design, but not very durable."
619,Kendal,clean water,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I can't compare it to other filtering water bottles, but so far, so good. It's a little on the large side, I'd really like a small version I could fit in my purse or something. But it looks nice, you can fit ice cubes in it if you want, and it's pretty easy to clean - no straws or other moving parts. So that's my review, for now. :-)"

622,NurseMom,Love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Perfect for all
623,KristyB.,hmm,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It may have the look of ""blown glass"" as the description states, but it's just plastic. I thought this was a glass bottle, which would have made it so much better.I ordered dirrectly from the Kor site and it wook weeks to get the order. So slow. The packaging was great, very minimal waste but still kept the bottles safe. Before you wash the bottles, they wreak. Such a heavy plastic smell.It's still got it's pluses though. It holds a lot of water, I like the size of the mouth opening, you can get ice cubes into it fairly easily, it's a distinct design, and it doesn't leak."
624,NubianKitten,Awesome product--not so awesome longevity,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This review is based on me purchasing from the Kor website, and not from Amazon.I purchased two of these units at separate times.  They are great bottles, holding just the right amount of water I'd need for the time I was at work or traveling.  I'd get compliments when I'd take it with me, and even had several friends buy bottles because of my own reviews.  Unfortunately I have to rate a low score on this product for the fact that BOTH of the bottles that I purchased have broken to the point of being unusable.  The first bottle met its fate thanks to an accidental bump from the kitchen counter, and it literally shattered across the floor.  I was pretty upset and thought that there was nothing I could do about it so I threw all the parts away.  After reading the reviews here on Amazon and seeing that people were getting their issues resolved if/when they happened, I ordered another one with the confidence that should another problem happen, I would be helped quickly and professionally.Well, another problem did arise in the form of another horribly cracked bottle from a slight fall.  I called the customer help line right away, only to be told that there was nothing that could be done, even with the (limited) lifetime warranty that supposedly comes with the purchase.  Even after I discussed what happened and that that was the second bottle to crap out on me, all that was offered was a $15 credit towards another purchase.  I asked ""Why would I want to spend more money on something that breaks at the slightest pressure?  One bottle broke after six months; another lasted five weeks.  I need something better than that.""  In the end nothing was resolved, and I now sit here with a beautiful but useless product.  I believe in the cause that Kor promotes--I just wish I could believe in their products a bit better."
625,Sandra,Love it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Love love love this water bottle. I love the color and the size of it, just makes it perfect and easy to carry around."
626,Danyo,Yeah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just like the picture, pretty heavy and hard plastic but it's cool."
627,Silke,Best Water Bottle Ever Made!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I just love this bottle. Makes you feel good as it is great for the environment and KOR is using only ""good"" plastics"" so at least you are not poisoning your body. Leak proof and great to use while working out. I can only recommend this product to anyone. Best Buy!"
628,Andzor Bolov,KOR ONE cap fragile and not reliable. Go rather for KOR AURA.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Do not buy KOR ONE bottles. The mechanism of the lockable cap is fragile. After about a year and a half of owning the bottle one of the two little hinged on the cap broke off and the bottle started leaking water. Go rather for KOR VIDA of KOR AURA. That's what I did after my KOR ONE bottle broke. The mechanism of the cap on these two models is simpler and, hence, more reliable and will serve you longer. And, having the same volume KOR AURA and KOR VIDA are more compact then KOR ONE - look generally slimmer and not as tall. They will take less space in your bag. Now, about KOR DELTA. It has the same shortcomings as KOR ONE when - it is bulky, and I would not trust the over complicated design of the cap on KOR DELTA. Remember the truth that - LESS IS MORE. The simpler a mechanism the more reliable it is. In addition, I bought KOR AURA (anthracite black) because it is transparent and I like being able to see how much water I still have left. And it is easier to see if it is time for your bottle to be washed from the inside. And then black plastic is more resilient to wear. The white plastic on my first KOR ONE looked soiled after a while, which is natural to expect."
629,J. L.,Overpriced and Overrated,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This bottle looks really cool and you will get people commenting on it, but it is not durable. It cannot survive any kind of minor fall due to the weak hinge component. If that gets damaged you're basically screwed and need to replace it. This happened to mine but I doubt I will replace it due to the steep price. $30 bucks was too much to begin with so I regret buying one now. There are cheaper, more durable bottles out there that are just as cool looking and BPA free as well. You want a bottle that's easy to use and abuse, not something you need to baby."
630,Runningmom,"Great idea, but hard to clean and molds easily",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  First one lasted 6 months, then the seal started to mold, replaced it, the same thing happened with the second.  I have never had this problem with any other water bottle...bummer.  Oh yeah, it doesnt fit in the water bottle holder in my car either."
631,Linda Taylor,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  One of my favorite water bottles! Comfortable to hold and drink out of!
632,Boo,I'm really disappointed with this purchase,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  When the cap is opened, the bottle contains sharp edges which could seriously cut the user. I'm really disappointed with this purchase, considering that I've always wanted to buy a Kor bottle."
633,Paul Kim,"Nice bottle, horrible durability",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I dropped it 2 ft off the ground and the whole thing cracked.  Nice bottle, horrible durability."

635,D. Cooper,Coolest water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The coolest water bottle.  It doesn't fit in small cup holder because of the oval shape of the bottle.  Has a large opening to allow you to put ice in the bottle.  The light blue color is very classy.This is not just another water bottle.  It will stand out among all the bottles on the shelf.  A little pricey but worth the money.
636,Amazon Customer,I was very excited to get a KOR ONE but when it broke not even 10 days after having it I wasn't that happy. The company has refu,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I got this item for Christmas. I was very excited to get a KOR ONE but when it broke not even 10 days after having it I wasn't that happy. The company has refused to refund me due to my brother (who bought The item) not having the  receipt. This water bottle is way to  fragile for the price they're asking for it. I definitely wouldn't recommend buying this unless your very sensitive to your water bottles and treat them like babies.
637,Lura L. Willhite,Add a strap!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The bottle is really easy to fill, and drink out of. It's made well and slips in and out of a big purse easily. Sometimes I want to be purse and hands free so a used a lanyard with a small carabiner to carry on my shoulder."

Sadly this has the same issue. Totally NOT leak proof and I have the waterlogged books to prove it. Also the ""stone"" rubber piece on top of these comes off almost immediately. The selling point is that it doesn't leak... but it does."
639,veronica heathcock,Customer Service is non-existant,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have the Nava Hydration Vessel and liked it so well I bought one for my brother and ordered him in addition at the same time the filter 2 pack since he is a truck driver.  When I opened the box the filter pack was not there.  I called, got no answer, left message, got no response 3 times.  I emailed twice, got no response.  At this point, I'm going to let the world know their customer service doesn't exit.  So if you want something after you order one, FORGET IT.  It's not worth the frustration.  Just don't order!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
640,Thu Maus,Love it Love it Love it!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a great product.  I love the color.  Water looks great in this bottle.  It's durable, clean, and best of all it has little messages you can put into the lid.  All my peers ask me where I've gotten it.  I carry it around because the handle is easy to hold and weightless."

643,Mike Foster,"Cool Bottle, but...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its a sharp looking bottle.  It really is, I got the black one.  I liked it a lot for the short amount of time I had it.But, I dropped it from about 2ft and it cracked along the front all the way to the back.  I had the thing for 3 days... Really kind of upset over that."

645,DistinguishedGentleman,A Gaze into the future,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Some say it is just a water bottle. No, it is retro futuristic satisfaction summed up into one little package of merch. Its curved edges, smooth materials, and whale like color scheme make it the appropriate tool for a gentleman aboard a space craft in 2001: a Space Odyssey. I encourage you to purchase this wonderful apparatus, as the year 2001 has already passed, and we should see private space flight technology with in the next couple of years."
646,Sky,Love it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've had this hydration vessel for several months now and I love it! Its probably one of the coolest, most innovative things I've seen this year. Its an interesting little piece of thing and I get random people that would stop me, ask me about it and say how cool it looks. I have been so happy with it that I bought one of the special edition ones just today from [...] using this coupon code that I found online: KWS-12433 and got up to 5 dollars off my purchase. This company is doing such great things donating 1% of the sales to the planet and eliminates my use of disposable bottles."

653,Panty Mython,Kor One Hydration Vessel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"   The Kor One Hydration Vessel is a rugged water bottle.

656,bsusean,The biggest issue for me is that I like to drink water really cold,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The biggest issue for me is that I like to drink water really cold.  You cannot use this water bottle with an ice machine on a typical fridge.  The top is too small.  I have to fill up another cup with ice and then manually transfer the ice to the water bottle.  Never thought when buying this bottle it would be such a pain to fill with ice.  I use it mostly at work and the ice maker in our work fridge does not come out very easily to just pull the ice out by hand, plus since it is at work and I do not want my co-workers seeing me dipping my hand in the shared ice machine."

658,Doc G,"Not study construction, mine cracked in first month",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  While this water bottle is a pleasure to use, it is simply not as durable as my $10 nalgene - and here is why.Both of them are made from the same Eastman Triton plastic, but the nalgenes have screw on lids on the top.  The Kor uses an actual metal joint to flip the lid back, which leaves it very vulnerable.I dropped it accidently from my desk to the tile floor while trying to shove it into my backpack, and a crack formed right near the hinge.  This was the first time it was dropped and the bottle was just two weeks old.I'm sorry, but I didn't spend $30 for something that needs to be treated like fine china.  If you plan on carrying around this alot and expect it to accidently be dropped, I strongly don't recommend it."

667,Christine MDF,"Love this look, Hate the function",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  My husband bought one of these bottles for me for my birthday because I was absolutely obsessed with having one. Used it daily at work and the gym for 3 weeks. Placed it in the top shelf of my dishwasher and it was never the same again. The top will not seal:( It doesn't look and now it leaks. So I thought, I guess that was just my fault. I bought a second bottle for me from the beyond yoga charity sale because I loved the message on it. Again, used it for weeks with no problems, then all of a sudden, the top stopped latching. I don not understand when you pay over 36 dollars for a bottle and after a few weeks leaks. I really really really wanted to love this bottle, but I guess I will have to go back to my Nalgene one."

671,pandich,Reality Check,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The price and overly complicated design make this a poor choice for serious water drinkers. Casual water drinkers may find it a pleasant tchotchke.
672,N.B.,Not going to last,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I don't own this water bottle only because I had the chance to play with a heavily used one from a promotion and hated it.The hinged lid eventually squeaks, really loudly.The super hip white gets dirty/marked upThe inside of the lid seems like it could be complicated to clean wellOverall, this water bottle seemed like just a lot of hype.I'm extremely skeptical of its ability to last long for how much it costs, mainly because hinged things that are complexly manufactured generally don't last as long as something more simple."
673,OrangeCrush,My Single Favorite Water Bottle Design!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been an avid outdoors enthusiast for well over 25 years so I have had my fair share of water bottles. Sigg, Nalgene, Camelbak, Kleen Kanteen, REI, Eddie Bauer Etc.. I have had bottles from all of them. In fact I dont think there is a design or a company out there that I haven't tried. With that being said I ran across a KOR One bottle at my local racquetball club. I was immediately impressed by the design and since I was looking to buy a new bottle anyways, I decided to order one.All I can say is WOW, just wow. What an absolutely brilliant design. It opens up with a push of a button and closes up just as fast. Its so easy to open you can literally do it with one hand. It has two handles at the top which makes it extremely easy to carry. The handles also make it extremely easy to attach to a bag or backpack. The KOR ONE is made from Eastman Tritan co-polyester, a groundbreaking new plastic that has extremely high clarity, is extremely durable, and is bisphenol-A (BPA) free.The total capacity of the KOR ONE is 750ml which is imo the absolute perfect size for a water bottle. Its not so large that it becomes a pain to carry and at the same time its not too small thus unable to hold enough fluid. For those who are not very good with measurements, most bottled drinks that are available at the store are usually 16 ounces which is equal to 473ml. That means with a 750ml size, the KOR ONE is able to hold 25 ounces which is the equivalent to roughly 1.5 bottled drinks. Again, imo this is just the perfect size for a water bottle.My single favorite aspect to these water bottles is the diameter and shape of the bottle opening. Your bottom lip fits the shape of the opening perfectly. I swear it literally feels like they took some sort of mold of my mouth and created the opening of this bottle specifically for me. This is not an exaggeration, the overall comfort and fit really is that good. Its absolutely perfect as its wide enough to be able to do some serious chugging yet not so wide that it winds up on your face and shirt. In all honesty its the best water bottle opening I have ever seen. In fact, none of the other water bottles I have tried can even begin to compete with KOR ONE in this regard. Of course it would be criminal of me not to mention how amazing these bottles look. IMO they are easily the best looking water bottles ever designed. Of course how a bottle looks is not nearly as important as how well it functions however when you get a bottle that functions this well and at the same time looks this good....well, lets just say its a huge bonus!!These bottles also have some exclusive features. First they have what are called Kor Stones, which are disc-shaped tokens that have an inspirational message on them. They fit into the lid of your bottle so you see it every time you open up your bottle and take a drink. They are supposed to provide you with a little bit of inspiration each time you drink. Of course you could easily create your own tokens and put whatever you want on them be it graphics or even your name and phone number in case you lose your bottle. You can also buy something called a Yoli Blast Cap. Its a small cap that also fits into the lid of the bottle. Its basically a flavored vitamins and nutrients packet. Simply break it open at any time and your plain water is immediately transformed into a flavored vitamin water. I personal think this is a very cool idea, unfortunately the blast caps are pretty expensive so I have chosen not to use this feature, at least not yet. Hopefully the Blast Caps will come down in price as more and more people begin to use them as I really do think its an outstanding idea especially for people who take their bottles to the gym. I would definitely use such a feature if the price was right.I have now been using my KOR One for around 5 months and the more I use it the more I have come to appreciate it. In fact, I now have 4 of them in total. I keep different drinks in each one and keep them stored in my fridge. In the morning I simply grab whichever one I am in the mood for and off I go.The bottom line - The KOR ONE is hands down my single favorite water bottle in existence. Again I have pretty much tried every brand and bottle design in existence and imo none of them can match what the KOR ONE gives you. If your looking for a new water bottle then you owe it to yourself to give these bottles a try. Yes, they really are that good.5 Stars!!"
674,Weconday Murray,I really like the style and color,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I really like the style and color, like the other KOR water bottles it's easy to carry or clip on to my backpack or fit in the side pockets."
675,Shakibing,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I love how stylish this bottle is. So easy to carry and the material feels durable and sturdy.
676,The Cat's Meow,"Meh, it's okay.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  So yeah, water bottle... I like the design, it's a really cool looking vessel, but it kind of reminds me of an oversized shampoo bottle. It is easy to drink from, just click open and sip. The rubber ring at the bottom provides good table top grip, and the open plastic at the top makes it easy to grab. I think I'm so ""meh"" about it because I was surprised that it's oval shaped instead of round, and because it's so big. I bought it to stay hydrated while bike commuting, but the size of the bottle is almost too big for my bike's water bottle holder. We'll see how it works out."
677,cheryl,Five Stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very nice, holds a lot of liquid and nicely ergonomic!"
678,Shantonu Kundu,"Great product, as usual",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great product, as usual.  I had a green one, but the lid broke when I dropped it from 5feet up.  Much better than aluminum bottles.  Great size."
679,hawkwing,Four Stars,4.0 out of 5 stars,  feel good
680,Thisblackguy,The One to Rule Them ALL!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Simply put, This water bottle is awesome! for the longest time I struggled with the ugly look of so many bottles, none of them every appeasing my eyes. Then I stumbled upon the KOR One. Don't let the pictures fool you this thing is a decent size. I actually purchased the ""Cobalt"" Blue color, but at the moment it is not available on amazon. When I first got this thing I worried about the hinge, and the bottom. The hinge is made of the same plastic that the translucent portion of the bottle is made out of and despite it's flimsy look, it has held up to several drops without so much as the slightest indication of wear. The bottom was also worrisome, as they designed it to appear to have a spherical bottom, when in fact the bottom is flat with a rubber ring for a good hold. I use this bottle eveyday, and have several times had it placed on less than level surfaces, and never had a problem with it standing upright by itself.The mouth of this thing is awesome, its like the size of a Gatorade bottle you can easily put refrigerator ice cubes in it.The bonus is the reactions I get from people when they see it. I've had people tell me it looks like everything from a storage container for an alien embryo to a portable space heater, to a handheld document scanner. It breaks away from the traditional look of a water bottle, than at first glance, nobody can figure out what it is."
681,SirJudas,Item has a weak spot,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was 99% satisfied with this product. As advertised, the bottle was gorgeous, leak-proof, heavy, easy to drink from, had no smell, robust... I kept good care of it, used it solely for room temperature water and never dropped it. Tragically though, the bottle tipped over onto its side when it standing upright on the floor (cement) and its hinge broke off with the plastic that surrounded it. The bottle was full at the time and must have been too heavy. This caused permanent damage to the cap, which no longer closed. According to Kor's warranty and return policy this damage would not have been covered because it doesn't have to do with the manufacturer. Sad.I would still recommend getting it - you'll be very happy if you don't mind the large size and relatively heavy weight. Just try not to drop it :)"
682,H.L.,I love this water bottle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love this water bottle. It is probably the best water bottle that I've had before. The plastic on the outside has scratched up a little bit; however, I haven't taken the best care of the bottle either. If you're looking for a temp control bottle, this isn't the one for you. The handle on the top of the bottle is great. I have to hand wash the bottle though because dish washers can't get all the way up into the bottle."
683,luv2shop19,Great water bottle...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is the best water bottle I have ever owned.  I purchased the limited edition, orchid color with art on the bottle.  Easy to wash, it is bacteria free as the nozzle is covered and ease of use."
